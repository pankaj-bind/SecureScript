      info        : "This setting ensures that all clients, users, servers are required to authenticate before being granted access to the MongoDB database.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client. When access control, i.e. authorization, is enabled, MongoDB requires all clients to authenticate themselves in order to determine their access.

from MongoDB documentation

Authentication Mechanisms

MongoDB supports a number of authentication mechanisms that clients can use to verify their identity. These mechanisms allow MongoDB to integrate into your existing authentication system.

MongoDB supports multiple authentication mechanisms:

SCRAM (Default)

x.509 Certificate Authentication.

Certificate Authority

For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates generated and signed by a certificate authority. You or your organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate authority, or use certificates generated by third-party TLS/SSL vendors.

In addition to supporting the aforementioned mechanisms, MongoDB Enterprise also supports the following mechanisms:

LDAP proxy authentication

Kerberos authentication.

Rationale:

Failure to authenticate clients, users, servers can enable unauthorized access to the MongoDB database and can prevent tracing actions back to their sources.

It's highly recommended that password length and complexity also be in-place. When performing the traditional user/password authentication against MongoDB there is not in-place intrinsic password complexity check and there is no LOCKING mechanism with multiple failure logins. So, MongoDB is prone to brute force attacks compared to other database systems."
      solution    : "The authentication mechanism should be implemented before anyone accesses the MongoDB Server.
To enable the authentication mechanism:

Start the MongoDB instance without authentication.

mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1

Or

mongod.exe --port 27017 --dbpath db1

Create the system user administrator, ensuring that its password meets organizationally-defined password in terms of length and complexity requirements as there is no in-place locking mechanism for multiple failed login attempts against MongoDB.

use admin
db.createUser(
  {
    user: 'MongoAdmin',
    pwd: 'password',
    roles: [ { role: 'root', db: 'admin' } ]
  }
)

Open mongod.conf and change for authorization value to enabled:

security:
    authorization: 'enabled'

Restart the MongoDB instance

service mongod restart

Default Value:

By default, authorization is set to disable."

      info        : "Servers can be configured to disable specific TLS/SSL protocol versions which may be vulnerable to exploitation and/or lack features which improve the level of security as provided by newer versions of the protocol.

Rationale:

The TLSv1.0 protocol is vulnerable to the BEAST attack when used in CBC mode (October 2011). Unfortunately, the TLSv1.0 uses CBC modes for all of the block mode ciphers, which only leaves the RC4 streaming cipher which is also weak and is not recommended. Therefore, it is recommended that the TLSv1.0 protocol be disabled. The TLSv1.1 protocol does not support Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) which is designed to simultaneously provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

The NIST SP 800-52r2 guidelines for TLS configuration require that TLS 1.2 is configured with FIPS-based cipher suites be supported by all government TLS servers and clients and requires support of TLS 1.3 by January 1, 2024. A September 2018 IETF draft also depreciates the usage of TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 as shown in the references.

If an attempt to connect using a disabled protocol is made the connection attempt will fail and may have unanticipated impact on clients attempting to establish the connection."
