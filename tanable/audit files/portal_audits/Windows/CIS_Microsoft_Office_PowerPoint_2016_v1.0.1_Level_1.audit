PowerPoint users can share and reuse slide content by storing individual slide files in a centrally located Slide Library on a server running Office SharePoint Server. Using the Slide Update feature, users can associate a slide in a presentation on a user's computer with the original slide that resides in the Slide Library on the server. By default, each time users open a presentation that contains a shared slide, PowerPoint notifies them if the slide has been updated and provides them with the opportunity to ignore the update, append a new slide to the outdated slide, or replace the outdated slide with the updated one. In some situations, updating a slide in a presentation from an external source like a Slide Library can cause important information to be lost. An attacker could modify the data in the slide library, affecting the integrity of all slide presentations that depend upon that library."

      info                 : "This policy setting determines whether PowerPoint automatically downloads links from external sources. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.  When users insert images into PowerPoint presentations, they can select Link to File instead of Insert. If they do so, the image is represented by a link to a file on disk instead of being embedded in the presentation file itself. By default, when PowerPoint opens a presentation it does not display any linked images saved on a different computer unless the presentation itself is saved in a trusted location (as configured in the Trust Center). If this configuration is changed, PowerPoint will load any images that were saved in remote locations, which presents a security risk."

User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft PowerPoint 2016\PowerPoint Options\Security\Unblock Automatic Download of Linked Images Impact: Disabling this setting enforces the default configuration of PowerPoint, and is therefore unlikely to cause significant usability issues for most users."
