      info        : 'This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The \'Allow data recovery agent\' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In \'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information\' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

Select \'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard\' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In \'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services\' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select \'Backup recovery password and key package\', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select \'Backup recovery password only\', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the \'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives\' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the \'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives\' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.'

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives\Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the \'Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM\' check box.

If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

Note: Setting this policy to Enabled triggers encryption of all drives (silently or non-silently based on AllowWarningForOtherDiskEncryption policy).

Note #2: Currently only full disk encryption is supported when using this CSP for silent encryption. For non-silent encryption, encryption type will depend on SystemDrivesEncryptionType and FixedDrivesEncryptionType configured on the device.

Encrypting drives on end-user devices helps prevent sensitive data at rest from being read in the event a device is lost or stolen. Enabling this setting is also a requirement to turning encryption on machines silently without prompting the end user."

When you disable the warning prompt, the OS drive's recovery key will back up to the user's Microsoft Entra account. When you allow the warning prompt, the user who receives the prompt can select where to back up the OS drive's recovery key.

The endpoint for a fixed data drive's backup is chosen in the following order:

 - The user's Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services account.
 - The user's Microsoft Entra account.
 - The user's personal OneDrive (MDM/MAM only).

Encryption will wait until one of these three locations backs up successfully.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled

Note: Starting in Windows 10, version 1803, the value 0 can only be set for Microsoft Entra joined devices. Windows will attempt to silently enable BitLocker for value 0.

Silent encryption enables BitLocker to encrypt data without prompting the user, ensuring the encryption process is uninterrupted."
