The Local Security Authority (LSA), which includes the LSASS process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled with UEFI Lock

Note: This additional protection to prevent reading memory and code injection by non-protected processes is supported by Windows 8.1 (or newer).

Provides added security for the credentials that LSA stores and manages. Enabling this setting with UEFI Lock prevents the setting from being changed remotely."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Enabled with UEFI Lock :

Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\Local Security Authority\Configures LSASS to run as a protected process

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template LocalSecurityAuthority.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 22H2 Administrative Templates v1.0 (or newer).

Note #2: In the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 23H2 Administrative Templates, the registry location of

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa:RunAsPPL

was set for

Configures LSASS to run as a protected process

. This same registry location and value was also created if the setting

Ensure 'LSA Protection' is set to 'Enabled'

was also applied. This appears to have been a mistake in the ADMX/ADML Templates for that release.

Starting with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 24H2 Administrative Templates, the setting

Configures LSASS to run as a protected process

has a new registry location of

HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System

. In addition, the setting

LSA Protection

will be displayed by GPME when this setting (

Configures LSASS to run as a protected process

) is configured.

If

Configures LSASS to run as a protected process

was configured using an older version of the ADML/ADML templates, the new registry location will not auto-apply to the system, and assessment scans using the latest benchmark might fail. To fix this issue, the ADMX/ADML templates must be updated to the latest version, the setting removed from the GPO, and then added back in.

If the Microsoft Windows 10 Benchmark is applied,

LSA Protection

is configured via a separate recommendation for older versions of the Windows 10 Operating System using the SecGuide.admx/adml templates. That configuration is checked for separately from this recommendation.

Impact:

Once this setting has been applied (Enabled), removing the group policy setting (set to Not Configured) will not reverse the impact. In order to reverse the impact, you must explicitly configure this setting to Disabled and follow

Microsoft's documentation on disabling the UEFI Lock

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory.

Impact:

Choosing the Secure Boot option provides the system with as much protection as is supported by the computer's hardware. A system with input/output memory management units (IOMMUs) will have Secure Boot with DMA protection. A system without IOMMUs will simply have Secure Boot enabled without DMA protection.

Choosing the Secure Boot with DMA protection option requires the system to have IOMMUs in order to enable VBS. Without IOMMU hardware support, VBS will be disabled.
