      info        : "Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.

Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

      solution    : "Identify any user using 'trust', 'sha-256-scram', md5', 'ident', 'peer' or 'password' as allowable access methods.

To identify users in the pg_hba.conf file using the methods listed above, open the pg_hba.conf file in a text editor, and inspect the contents of the file, looking for uncommented lines with these methods. Optionally, the following command can be run from a Windows command prompt to identify any uncommented lines in the pg_hba.conf file that may be using these methods:

 type <postgresql pg_hba.conf directory>\pg_hba.conf | findstr /N 'scram-sha-256 md5 trust password peer ident' | find /V /N '#'

Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

When availability is an overriding concern, approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows:

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the DBMS must continue generating audit records, if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), and overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

Systems where availability is paramount will most likely be MAC I; the final determination is the prerogative of the application owner, subject to Authorizing Official concurrence. In any case, sufficient auditing resources must be allocated to avoid audit data loss in all but the most extreme situations.

      solution    : "Establish a process with accompanying tools for monitoring available disk space and ensuring that sufficient disk space is maintained in order to continue generating audit logs, overwriting the oldest existing records if necessary.

If the organization does not employ an existing log management utility, the following example identifies one approach that may be followed to rotate EDB audit log files on Windows.

Determine the maximum size of the audit log directory. For this example fix, assume the audit log directory must have a maximum size of 100MB. Divide the maximum size of the directory by 10 to determine the size of the log files for rotation. For this example, the audit log file size will be set to 10Mb. Perform the following steps to ensure that the audit log directory is never more than 90% full and the oldest logs are removed to make room for new logs:

1) Execute the following SQL statements to review current auditing related settings and to configure EPAS to generate a new audit log file when the current log file has reached the log file size determined above (10 Mb):

 -- List current EDB Audit settings
 SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE category LIKE 'EnterpriseDB Audit%' ORDER BY name;

 /*
 * Note: If edb_audit is not set to 'csv' or 'xml', auditing is not enabled.
 * To enable EDB auditing, issue one of the following SQL statements:
 *
 * ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit TO 'xml';
 *
 * or
 *
 * ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit TO 'csv';
 *
 */

 -- Set edb_audit_filename parameter to ensure unique name for each log file that is generated
 ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit_filename TO 'audit-%Y%m%d_%H%M%S';

 -- Set edb_audit_rotation_size to desired maximum file size (e.g., 10 Mb)
 ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit_rotation_size TO 10;

 -- Reload configuration settings to put the updated settings into effect
 SELECT pg_reload_conf();

 -- List current EDB Audit settings to confirm updates are in place
 SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE category LIKE 'EnterpriseDB Audit%' ORDER BY name;

2) Using a text editor, create a Windows batch file with the following content:

 @ECHO OFF
 SETLOCAL
 SET 'targetdir=<Path to edb_audit Directory>'
 SET /a retain=8

 FOR /f 'skip=%retain%delims=' %%a IN (
 'dir /b /a-d /o-d '%targetdir%\audit-????????_??????.xml' '
 ) DO DEL '%targetdir%\%%a'

 GOTO :EOF

3) Replace '<Path to edb_audit Directory>' for 'targetdir' variable in the batch file (3rd line) to correspond to the EDB audit log directory configured for your EPAS instance. Note that the EDB audit log directory is configured by the edb_audit_directory parameter. By default, the edb_audit_directory is set to 'edb_audit', which results in an 'edb_audit' directory being created under the EPAS cluster's data directory for audit logs if auditing is enabled. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d <database name> -U <database superuser name> -c 'SHOW data_directory'

where, <database name> is any database in the EDB postgres instance and <database superuser name> is a database superuser. By default, a database named 'edb' and a superuser named 'enterprisedb' are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

If default setting of 'edb_audit' is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be <EDB Postgres data directory>\edb_audit.

4) Update the 'retain' variable in the batch file (4th line) to correspond to the desired minimum number of audit log files that should be retained in the directory. It should be set so that sufficient headroom is maintained in the directory for log files generated between runs of the batch file.

5) Save the batch file to a location that would be accessible to the Windows Task Scheduler. For this example, save the file to 'C:\Windows\System32\Manage_EDB_Audit_Logs.bat'.

6) Using the Windows Task Scheduler, create a scheduled task to execute the Manage_EDB_Audit_Logs.bat file on a periodic basis. At a minimum, it is recommended that the task be scheduled to perform this action at least on an hourly basis. Depending on the various audit log settings and database activity, it may be necessary to configure the task to be run more frequently."

In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections and limiting log data location.

Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records should not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the application. If the application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.

          info        : "Use of weak or not validated cryptographic algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption and digital signatures to protect data. Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

The standard for validating cryptographic modules will transition to the NIST FIPS 140-3 publication.

FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to 5 years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list.  Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While Federal Agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose. CMVP recommends purchasers consider all modules that appear on the Validated Modules Search Page:
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules

More information on the FIPS 140-3 transition can be found here:
https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/fips-140-3-transition-effort/

When the EDB FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules are configured properly, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server will fail to start if non-FIPS 140 ciphers are specified for the Postgres ssl_ciphers parameter. To test whether the FIPS 140 compliant configuration is working, temporarily set the 'ssl_ciphers' parameter in the postgresql.conf file to 'RC4-SHA' and then attempt to restart the database service. Since 'RC4-SHA' is not a FIPS 140 approved cipher, the database will fail to start. Using the Event Viewer in Windows, a 'FATAL: could not set the cipher list (no valid ciphers available)' error will be found under 'Event Viewer (Local) >> Windows Logs >> Application'.

Note that the default location for the pg_hba.conf file is in the postgresql data directory. The location of the pg_hba.conf file for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt:

 psql -d <database name> -U <database superuser name> -c 'SHOW hba_file'

where, <database name> is any database in the EDB postgres instance and <database superuser name> is a database superuser. By default, a database named 'edb' and a superuser named 'enterprisedb' are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

Execute the following SQL as enterprisedb:

 ALTER SYSTEM SET port = <port>;

Restart the database service.

To restart the database service, using the Windows Services Control Manager:
 1. Open the Windows Services Control Manager.
 2. Select the database service from the list of services, right-click it, and select 'Restart'.

Alternatively, the database can be restarted via the Windows command line using either the NET or SC command as follows:

 NET STOP <service name>
 NET START <service name>

or

 SC STOP <service name>
 SC START <service name>

In the above commands, replace <service name> with the actual service name corresponding to the EDB Postgres instance.

Note that if pgAgent is installed and running, the corresponding pgAgent service is dependent on the EDB Postgres database service and must first be stopped to restart the database service. After restarting the database service, the pgAgent service may be started again."

          info        : "Use of weak or not validated cryptographic algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption and digital signatures to protect data. Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

The standard for validating cryptographic modules will transition to the NIST FIPS 140-3 publication.

FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to 5 years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list.  Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While Federal Agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose. CMVP recommends purchasers consider all modules that appear on the Validated Modules Search Page:
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules

More information on the FIPS 140-3 transition can be found here:
https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/fips-140-3-transition-effort/

When the EDB FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules are configured properly, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server will fail to start if non-FIPS 140 ciphers are specified for the Postgres ssl_ciphers parameter. To test whether the FIPS 140 compliant configuration is working, temporarily set the 'ssl_ciphers' parameter in the postgresql.conf file to 'RC4-SHA' and then attempt to restart the database service. Since 'RC4-SHA' is not a FIPS 140 approved cipher, the database will fail to start. Using the Event Viewer in Windows, a 'FATAL: could not set the cipher list (no valid ciphers available)' error will be found under 'Event Viewer (Local) >> Windows Logs >> Application'.
