      info        : "Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing a DBMS. Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in, or added to, the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible.
Note: it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but ten might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)

Note that by default if no connection limit is specified, when a Postgres database user is created it will be allowed to have an unlimited number of concurrent sessions. The EDB Postgres CREATE USER and the PostgreSQL CREATE ROLE sql commands, which are used to create database users, provide a CONNECTION LIMIT option for configuring the allowable number of concurrent sessions for a user. It is good administrative practice to use this option to set the connection limit when new users are created. However, if a user was created without a connection limit or if the assigned connection limit needs to be changed, the CONNECTION LIMIT option can be set using the ALTER USER and ALTER ROLE commands."

  info        : "Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the DBMS. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Non-repudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database.

In designing a database, the organization must define the types of data and the user actions that must be protected from repudiation.

-Sufficient information to establish what type of events occurred
-Sufficient information to establish where the events occurred
-Sufficient information to establish the sources (origins) of the events
-Sufficient information to establish the outcome (success or failure) of the events

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. To support analysis, some types of events will need information to be logged that exceeds the basic requirements of event type, time stamps, location, source, outcome, and user identity. If additional information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events.

The organization must determine what additional information is required for complete analysis of the audited events.

Examples of detailed information the organization may require in audit records are full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

Applications are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., email and web services); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the application must support the organizational requirements providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

Database Management Systems using ports, protocols, and services deemed unsafe are open to attack through those ports, protocols, and services. This can allow unauthorized access to the database and through the database to other components of the information system.

A Postgres database cluster (i.e., instance) listens for connections on a single TCP port. The default port for an EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster is 5444; however, the port number that is used is configurable via the Postgres 'port' parameter. A database restart is required to apply a change to the port parameter. Also by default, a Postgres cluster will listen for connections on all interfaces on the host. The 'listen_addresses' parameter can be used to configure specific interfaces on the host to listen for connections. The default value of '*' indicates all interfaces are used. To listen only on specific interfaces, the listen_addresses parameter is configured with a comma-separated list of host names and/or numeric IP addresses corresponding to the interfaces that should be used.

  info        : "Use of weak or not validated cryptographic algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption and digital signatures to protect data. Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS.

Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules.

The standard for validating cryptographic modules will transition to the NIST FIPS 140-3 publication.

FIPS 140-2 modules can remain active for up to 5 years after validation or until September 21, 2026, when the FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the historical list.  Even on the historical list, CMVP supports the purchase and use of these modules for existing systems. While Federal Agencies decide when they move to FIPS 140-3 only modules, purchasers are reminded that for several years there may be a limited selection of FIPS 140-3 modules from which to choose. CMVP recommends purchasers consider all modules that appear on the Validated Modules Search Page:
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules

More information on the FIPS 140-3 transition can be found here:
https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/fips-140-3-transition-effort/

When the EDB FIPS 140 certified cryptographic modules are configured properly, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server will fail to start if non-FIPS 140 ciphers are specified for the Postgres ssl_ciphers parameter. To test whether the FIPS 140 compliant configuration is working, temporarily set the 'ssl_ciphers' parameter in the postgresql.conf file to 'RC4-SHA' and then attempt to restart the database service. Since 'RC4-SHA' is not a FIPS 140 approved cipher, the database will fail to start. Using the Event Viewer in Windows, a 'FATAL: could not set the cipher list (no valid ciphers available)' error will be found under 'Event Viewer (Local) >> Windows Logs >> Application'.

  info        : "Any DBMS or associated application providing too much information in error messages on the screen or printout risks compromising the data and security of the system. The structure and content of error messages must be carefully considered by the organization and development team.

Databases can inadvertently provide a wealth of information to an attacker through improperly handled error messages. In addition to sensitive business or personal information, database errors can provide host names, IP addresses, user names, and other system information not required for troubleshooting but very useful to someone targeting the system.

Carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed, and must document what has been discovered.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info        : "If EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides too much information in error logs and administrative messages to the screen, this could lead to compromise. The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.

Some default EDB Postgres Advanced Server error messages can contain information that could aid an attacker in, among others things, identifying the database type, host address, or state of the database. Custom errors may contain sensitive customer information.

It is important that detailed error messages be visible only to those who are authorized to view them; that general users receive only generalized acknowledgment that errors have occurred; and that these generalized messages appear only when relevant to the user's task. For example, a message along the lines of, 'An error has occurred. Unable to save your changes. If this problem persists, please contact your help desk' would be relevant. A message such as 'Warning: your transaction generated a large number of page splits' would likely not be relevant.

Administrative users authorized to review detailed error messages typically are the ISSO, ISSM, SA, and DBA. Other individuals or roles may be specified according to organization-specific needs, with appropriate approval.

In addition to ensuring that access to EDB Postgres Advanced Server database and audit logs is restricted to authorized users and that EDB Postgres Advanced Server is configured to emit minimal information to clients related to Postgres generated errors, custom database code and external application code should also be designed to not emit detailed error messages to a client. This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.

# Update EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log permissions.
If the EDB Postgres Advanced Server log_destination parameter is set to 'stderr' or 'csvlog':

1) Change ownership of EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log directory and its contents to the database service account if they are not owned by the database service account.

If the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log directory and its contents are not owned by the database service account, change ownership to the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the log directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select 'Properties', select the 'Securities' tab, and select the 'Advanced' button.
 Select the 'Change' link shown next to the owner of the folder to change the folder's owner.

Alternatively, the Windows TAKEOWN command or the ICACLS command (with the /SETOWNER option) may be used to change ownership of folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

2) Modify permissions on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database log directory and its contents to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the log directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select 'Properties', and select the 'Security' tab.
 Modify the security permissions to:
 NT AUTHORITY/NetworkService (or configured database service account) (Full Control)
 Administrators (Read)
 Users (none)

Alternatively, the Windows ICACLS command may be used to modify permissions on folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

If the EDB Postgres Advanced Server log_destination parameter is set to 'eventlog', update the Windows policy settings to only allow access to the Windows Application event log to authorized users.

If other permissions have been granted to other users or groups, ensure that the system documentation is updated to note the organizationally approved permission setting and corresponding justification of the permission settings for this requirement.

# Update EDB Audit log permissions.
1) Change ownership of EDB Audit directory and its contents to the database service account if they are not owned by the database service account.

If the EDB Audit directory and its contents are not owned by the database service account, change ownership to the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service.

This may be done using Windows Explorer:
 Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located.
 Select and right-click on the folder, select 'Properties', select the 'Securities' tab, and select the 'Advanced' button.
 Select the 'Change' link shown next to the owner of the folder to change the folder's owner.

Alternatively, the Windows TAKEOWN command or the ICACLS command (with the /SETOWNER option) may be used to change ownership of folders and files using the Windows command prompt.

2) Modify permissions on the EDB Audit directory and its contents to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

Session termination ends all processes associated with a user's logical session except those batch processes/jobs that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

      info        : "Without the association of security labels to information, there is no basis for EDB Postgres Advanced Server to make security-related access-control decisions.

Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information.

These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., tables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy.

One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security labels may be assigned manually or during data processing, but, either way, it is imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If the security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.

The mechanism used to support security labeling may be a feature of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, a third-party product, or custom application code.

In addition to being able to grant privileges on tables using standard SQL features, EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides a Row Level Security (RLS) feature. This feature provides the ability to define and enable row level security policies that restrict insert, update, delete, and select access on the rows of a table on a per user basis. For deployments within the DoD, RLS policies are configured to use the assigned security labels."

  description : "EP11-00-007300 - EDB Postgres Advanced Server must enforce discretionary access control policies, as defined by the data owner, over defined subjects and objects."
  info        : "Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are 'owners' of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects.

A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.

The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.

<report type:"WARNING">
  description : "EP11-00-007400 - The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions, to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures."
  info        : "Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

In Postgres, a user or group role that has been granted the SUPERUSER privilege can perform any action in the database. As such, the SUPERUSER privilege should only be granted to a limited set of approved users. The SUPERUSER privilege can be assigned to a role when the role is created. It can also be assigned or removed from a role via an ALTER ROLE statement.

Postgres also provides the CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, REPLICATION, and BYPASSURLS privileges that can be granted to non-superuser roles to allow them to perform a limited set of privileged activities such as creating databases, creating user and group roles, managing replication slots, and bypassing row level security restrictions. Although not as all-encompassing as the SUPERUSER privilege, these privileges must only be granted to users who are approved to perform these activities. Like the SUPERUSER privilege, these privileges can be assigned to a role when the role is created. They can also be assigned or removed from a role via an ALTER ROLE statement. The PostgreSQL CREATE ROLE documentation provides more information about these privileges. See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html

In addition to the SUPERUSER, CREATEDB, and CREATEROLE privileges, a user may be granted one or more default roles that provide access to certain privileged capabilities and activities. A listing and description of the default roles provided with Postgres is documented at the following link:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html

Roles and privileges on database objects can be granted to or revoked from a user using the GRANT and REVOKE statements. Users that are granted a role with the ADMIN OPTION can in turn grant the role to other users and roles. The ADMIN OPTION should only be granted to user and group roles that are approved to grant the roles. A description of the available privileges that may be granted to the different types of Postgres database objects is documented at the following link:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html

Also in Postgres, for most object types, object owners can perform any action on the objects they own, including dropping or altering them and assigning or revoking privileges on them. As such, database objects should only be owned by users who are approved to own them.

Another security risk to consider, is that Postgres can be extended with additional procedural languages that can be used to create user defined functions (i.e., not provided by EDB Postgres Advanced Server out-of-the-box). Some of these languages, such as pl/Python and pl/R are defined as 'untrusted' languages. Any users who are granted access to these untrusted languages are able to run user defined functions to escalate privileges and perform unintended functions. These languages allow a Postgres database to be extended with additional capabilities that may be of benefit to a system. However, usage of these languages should only be granted to approved users for documented and approved purposes.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Update system documentation to accurately identify all user and group roles that are authorized to perform privileged actions.

If the SUPERUSER, CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, REPLICATION, or BYPASSRLS privileges have been assigned to a user or group role that is not approved to have these privileges, remove the privilege using the ALTER ROLE SQL command as necessary.

 The syntax is:
 ALTER ROLE <role> NOSUPERUSER
 ALTER ROLE <role> NOCREATEROLE
 ALTER ROLE <role> NOCREATEDB
 ALTER ROLE <role> NOREPLICATION
 ALTER ROLE <role> NOBYPASSURLS

 Examples:
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOSUPERUSER
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOCREATEROLE
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOCREATEDB
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOREPLICATION
 ALTER ROLE testuser NOBYPASSURLS

If an unapproved user or group role is the owner of a database object, change the owner to an approved user or group role using one of the following ALTER SQL commands as appropriate:

 The syntax is:
 ALTER DATABASE <database name> OWNER TO <new_owner>
 ALTER SCHEMA <schema name> OWNER TO <new_owner>
 ALTER TABLE <table name> OWNER TO <new_owner>
 ALTER SEQUENCE <sequence name> OWNER TO <new_owner>
 ALTER VIEW <view name> OWNER TO <new_owner>
 ALTER FUNCTION <function name> (<args>) OWNER TO <new_owner>
 ALTER PROCEDURE <procedure name> (<args>) OWNER TO <new_owner>

 Examples:
 ALTER DATABASE test_db OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER SCHEMA test_schema OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER TABLE test_tbl OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER SEQUENCE test_seq OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER VIEW test_vw OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER FUNCTION test_func (p1 numeric, p2 text) OWNER TO app_admin
 ALTER PROCEDURE test_proc (p1 numeric, p2 text) OWNER TO app_admin

If a user or group role has been granted an unapproved role or object privilege, execute the appropriate REVOKE command as documented here:

 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-revoke.html

Update the system documentation to identify the intended use, scope, and justification for any 'untrusted' procedural languages that are being used for user defined functions as well as the users who are approved to use these languages and corresponding functions.

If an unapproved user defined function exists, remove it from the database by executing the DROP FUNCTION SQL command as documented here:

 https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropfunction.html

If an unapproved procedural language is installed, remove it from the database by executing the following SQL command:

Although another requirement (SRG-APP-000515-DB-000318) mandates that audit data be off-loaded to a centralized log management system, it remains necessary to provide space on the database server to serve as a buffer against outages and capacity limits of the off-loading mechanism.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the DBMS and is closely associated with the DBA and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider such factors as: total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are off-loaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by off-loaded records.

However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections.

This requirement guards against adverse or unintended system behavior caused by invalid inputs, where information system responses to the invalid input may be disruptive or cause the system to fail into an unsafe state.

The behavior will be derived from the organizational and system requirements and includes, but is not limited to, notification of the appropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

  info        : "Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Timeframes for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).
