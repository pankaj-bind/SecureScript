  description : "EPAS-00-000100 - The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must limit the number of concurrent sessions to an organization-defined number per user for all accounts and/or account types."
  info        : "Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing a DBMS. Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)"

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Nonrepudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database.

In designing a database, the organization must define the types of data and the user actions that must be protected from repudiation. The implementation must then include building audit features into the application data tables, and configuring the DBMS' audit tools to capture the necessary audit trail. Design and implementation also must ensure that applications pass individual user identification to the DBMS, even where the application connects to the DBMS with a standard, group account."

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DOD has defined the list of events for which the DBMS will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities, or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; and

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. To support analysis, some types of events will need information to be logged that exceeds the basic requirements of event type, time stamps, location, source, outcome, and user identity. If additional information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events.

The organization must determine what additional information is required for complete analysis of the audited events.

Examples of detailed information the organization may require in audit records are full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

  info        : "An isolation boundary provides access control and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions.

Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.

Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.

Database Management Systems typically separate security functionality from nonsecurity functionality via separate databases or schemas. Database objects or code implementing security functionality should not be commingled with objects or code implementing application logic. When security and nonsecurity functionality are commingled, users who have access to nonsecurity functionality may be able to access security functionality.

-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc. will never be valid, reject them.
-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL, these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.
-- If SQL key words such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, or REVOKE will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input.

Carefully consider the structure and content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed, and must document what has been discovered.

      info        : "If the DBMS provides too much information in error logs and administrative messages to the screen, this could lead to compromise. The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.

Some default DBMS error messages can contain information that could aid an attacker in, among other things, identifying the database type, host address, or state of the database. Custom errors may contain sensitive customer information.

It is important that detailed error messages be visible only to those who are authorized to view them; that general users receive only generalized acknowledgment that errors have occurred; and that these generalized messages appear only when relevant to the user's task. For example, a message along the lines of, 'An error has occurred. Unable to save your changes. If this problem persists, contact the help desk' would be relevant. A message such as 'Warning: your transaction generated a large number of page splits' would likely not be relevant.

Administrative users authorized to review detailed error messages typically are the ISSO, ISSM, SA, and DBA. Other individuals or roles may be specified according to organization-specific needs, with appropriate approval.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers.

Privilege elevation must be utilized only where necessary and protected from misuse.

It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial installation of the DBMS and is closely associated with the DBA and system administrator roles. The DBA or system administrator will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the application owner/installer and the application will prompt the installer to provide the capacity information, the physical location of the disk, or both.

In determining the capacity requirements, consider factors such as total number of users; expected number of concurrent users during busy periods; number and type of events being monitored; types and amounts of data being captured; the frequency/speed with which audit records are off-loaded to the central log management system; and any limitations that exist on the DBMS's ability to reuse the space formerly occupied by off-loaded records.

  description : "EPAS-00-009600 - The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of information during reception."
  info        : "Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during reception, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information.

This requirement applies only to those applications that are either distributed or can allow access to data nonlocally. Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process.

When receiving data, the DBMS, associated applications, and infrastructure must leverage protection mechanisms.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications. To enable the use of SSL, the postgres 'ssl' configuration parameter must be set to 'on', and the database instance needs to be configured to use a valid server certificate and private key installed on the server. With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted. However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from nonlocal hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections. The hostssl connections can be further configured to require that the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection."
  solution    : "To configure EDB Postgres Advanced Server to use SSL, open the 'postgresql.conf' file in an editor. The default location for the postgresql.conf file is in the postgresql data directory (PGDATA). The location of the postgresql.conf for a running EDB Postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a command prompt:

> psql -d <database-name> -U <username> -c 'SHOW config_file'

Where <database-name> is any database in the EDB postgres instance and <username> is a database superuser. By default, a database named 'edb' and a superuser named 'enterprisedb' are installed
with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

In the postgresql.conf file, set the 'ssl' parameter as follows:

ssl = on

Ensure the parameter is uncommented.

In order to start an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance in SSL mode, files containing the server certificate and private key must exist. By default, these files are expected to exist in the Postgres data directory and are expected to be named server.crt and server.key, respectively. Update the ssl_cert_file and ssl_cert_key parameters in the postgresql.conf file if the files are placed in a different location or are named differently.

Note that changes to the SSL parameter setting and any of the other SSL- related parameters require a database server restart to be put the changes into effect.

To restart the database on a systemd server, issue the following command as the root user or a user with sudo access:

> systemctl restart edb-as-<version>

Where <version> is the major version of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance (e.g., 15).

To restart the database, issue the following command as the root user or a user with sudo access:

> systemctl restart edb-as-<version>

Where <version> is the major version of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance (e.g., 14).

After verifying that SSL is enabled for the database, open the pg_hba.conf file in an editor to configure the host-based authentication settings. Note that the default location for the pg_hba.conf file is in the postgresql data directory (PGDATA). The location of the pg_hba.conf file for a running EDB postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a command prompt:

> psql -d <database-name> -U <username> -c 'SHOW hba_file'

Where <database-name> is any database in the EDB postgres instance and <username> is a database superuser. By default, a database named 'edb' and a superuser named 'enterprisedb' are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

Obtain approval and document any uncommented entries with corresponding justification that are not of type hostssl and do not include the 'clientcert=1' option.

For any entries that are not of type hostssl authentication with the 'clientcert=1' option and not documented and approved, change the 'TYPE' column to 'hostssl' and add the 'clientcert=1' authentication method option.

Note that changes to the host-based authentication settings require a database reload in order to apply the updated settings."

  info        : "Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Timeframes for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

A privileged function in this context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings.

GRANT
REVOKE

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, audit logging may be achieved by means of DBMS auditing features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.
