      info        : "Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

PostgreSQL must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.

Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements."

          info        : "Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access PostgreSQL. To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If PostgreSQL does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.

The following are examples of how to use role privileges in PostgreSQL to enforce access controls. For a complete list of privileges, see the official documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createrole.html

#### Roles Example 1

The following example demonstrates how to create an admin role with CREATEDB and CREATEROLE privileges.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'CREATE ROLE admin WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE'

#### Roles Example 2

The following example demonstrates how to create a role with a password that expires and makes the role a member of the 'admin' group.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'CREATE ROLE joe LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'stig2016!' VALID UNTIL '2016-09-20' IN ROLE admin'

#### Roles Example 3

The following demonstrates how to revoke privileges from a role using REVOKE.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'REVOKE admin FROM joe'

#### Roles Example 4

The following demonstrates how to alter privileges in a role using ALTER.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'ALTER ROLE joe NOLOGIN'

The following are examples of how to use grant privileges in PostgreSQL to enforce access controls on objects. For a complete list of privileges, see the official documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-grant.html

#### Grant Example 1

The following example demonstrates how to grant INSERT on a table to a role.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'GRANT SELECT ON stig_test TO joe'

#### Grant Example 2

The following example demonstrates how to grant ALL PRIVILEGES on a table to a role.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON stig_test TO joe'

#### Grant Example 3

The following example demonstrates how to grant a role to a role.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'GRANT admin TO joe'

#### Revoke Example 1

The following example demonstrates how to revoke access from a role.

As the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), run the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ psql -c 'REVOKE admin FROM joe'

To change authentication requirements for the database, as the database administrator (shown here as 'postgres'), edit pg_hba.conf:

$ sudo su - postgres

$ vi ${PGDATA?}/pg_hba.conf

Edit authentication requirements to the organizational requirements. See the official documentation for the complete list of options for authentication: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html

After changes to pg_hba.conf, reload the server:

# SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY
$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}

# INITD SERVER ONLY
$ sudo service postgresql-${PGVER?} reload"

          info        : "Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are 'owners' of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects.

A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.

The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

For more information on configuring PostgreSQL to use SSL, consult the following documentation:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html

Postgres provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications.  To enable the use of SSL, the postgres 'ssl' configuration parameter must be set to 'on' and the database instance needs to be configured to use a valid server certificate and private key installed on the server.  With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted.  However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections.  The hostssl connections can be further configured to require that the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection."

Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.

Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles.

Database Management Systems typically separate security functionality from non-security functionality via separate databases or schemas. Database objects or code implementing security functionality should not be commingled with objects or code implementing application logic. When security and non-security functionality are commingled, users who have access to non-security functionality may be able to access security functionality.

Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process.

When transmitting data, PostgreSQL, associated applications, and infrastructure must leverage transmission protection mechanisms.

For more information on configuring PostgreSQL to use SSL, consult the following documentation:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html

Postgres provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications.  To enable the use of SSL, the postgres 'ssl' configuration parameter must be set to 'on' and the database instance needs to be configured to use a valid server certificate and private key installed on the server.  With SSL enabled, connections made to the database server will default to being encrypted.  However, it is possible for clients to override the default and attempt to establish an unencrypted connection. To prevent connections made from non-local hosts from being unencrypted, the postgres host-based authentication settings should be configured to only allow hostssl (i.e., encrypted) connections.  The hostssl connections can be further configured to require that the client present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate for a connection."
