  description : "SQL4-00-000100 - The number of concurrent SQL Server sessions for each system account must be limited."
  info        : "A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices on an organization's internal network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.

One way SQL Server can limit exposure to DoS attacks is to restrict the number of connections that can be opened by a single user. SQL Server supports this through the use of logon triggers. (Note, however, that this need not be the only, or even the principal, means for satisfying this requirement. Depending on the architecture and capabilities of the network and application, a network device or an application may be more suitable for providing this protection.)

When determining the appropriate values for this limit, take the characteristics of the various kinds of user into account, and bear in mind that some applications and some users may need to have multiple sessions open. For example, while a standard account using a simple application may never need more than, say, five connections, a database administrator using SQL Server Management Studio may need significantly more, because each tab in that application counts as a distinct session.

Architectural note: In SQL Server, a count of active sessions by user can be obtained from one of the dynamic management views. For example:
      SELECT original_login_name, count(*)
      FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
      WHERE is_user_process = 1
      GROUP BY original_login_name;
However, for this to return an accurate count in a logon trigger, the user would have to have the View Server State privilege. (Without this privilege, the trigger sees information only about the current session, so would always return a count of one.) View Server State would give that user access to a wide swath of information about the server.  One way to avoid this exposure is to create a summary table, and a view of that table that restricts each user to seeing his/her own count, and establish a frequently-run background job to refresh the table (using the above query or similar). The logon trigger then queries the view to obtain a count that is accurate enough for this purpose in most circumstances.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Establish the limit(s) appropriate to the type(s) of user account accessing the SQL Server instance, and record them in the system documentation.

Implement one or more logon triggers to enforce the limit(s), without exposing the dynamic management views to general users."

  description : "SQL4-00-002010 - SQL Server must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to server-level system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies."
  info        : "Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the SQL Server instance and server-level resources.  To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including SQL Server instances, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes SQL Server.  If SQL Server is not configured to follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects against later claims by a user of not having created, modified, or deleted a particular data item or collection of data in the database.

Use of shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users (as in connection pooling).

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

  info        : "Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

Account management and authentication in a Windows environment normally use an LDAP-compatible directory service, usually Windows Active Directory.  This in turn, in the DoD environment, is typically integrated with the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  Additional technologies or products may be employed that when placed together constitute an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.  An example is the use of Group Policy Objects to enforce rules concerning passwords.

SQL Server must be configured to use Windows authentication, with SQL Server authentication disabled.  If circumstances (such as the architecture of a purchased application) make it necessary to have SQL Server authentication available, its use must be kept to a minimum.  The reasons for its use, and the measures taken to restrict it to only the necessary cases, must be documented, with AO approval.

It is assumed throughout this STIG that this integration has been implemented."
  solution    : "If mixed mode is required, document the need and justification; describe the measures taken to ensure the use of SQL Server authentication is kept to a minimum; describe the measures taken to safeguard passwords; list or describe the SQL Logins used; obtain official approval.

In the SSMS Object Explorer, right-click on the server instance; select Properties.  Select the Security page.  Click on the radio button for Windows Authentication Mode.  Click on 'OK.'  Restart the SQL Server instance.

SQLCMD and other command-line tools are part of any SQL Server installation. These tools can accept a plain-text password, but do offer alternative techniques. Since the typical user of these tools is a database administrator, the consequences of password compromise are particularly serious. Therefore, the use of plain-text passwords must be prohibited, as a matter of practice and procedure."

USE [master]
GO

GO

If mixed-mode authentication is necessary, then for SQLCMD, which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password when mixed-mode authentication is enabled, and any other essential tool with the same limitation:
1) Document the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain AO approval.
2) Train all users of the tool in the importance of not using the plain-text password option and in how to keep the password hidden."

Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.  Note also that Trace does not support auditing of SELECT statements, whereas Audit does.

Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all accesses, successful and otherwise, to all schema-scoped objects.  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at all."

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or

(i) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the DBMS must continue generating audit records, if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), preferably overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.

(ii) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the DBMS must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.

Systems where availability is paramount will most likely be MAC I; the final determination is the prerogative of the application owner, subject to Authorizing Official concurrence. In any case, sufficient auditing resources must be allocated to avoid audit data loss in all but the most extreme situations.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.

However, although Trace supports FIFO rollover, SQL Server Audit does not:  its CONTINUE option stops the production of new audit records when there is an audit failure."
      solution    : "If SQL Server Audit is in use, configure SQL Server Audit to continue to generate audit records, overwriting the oldest existing records, in the case of an auditing failure.

Systems where audit trail completeness is paramount will most likely be at a lower MAC level than MAC I; the final determination is the prerogative of the application owner, subject to Authorizing Official concurrence. In any case, sufficient auditing resources must be allocated to avoid a shutdown in all but the most extreme situations.

Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.

      info        : "If audit data were to become compromised, competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could potentially use to his or her advantage.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

SQL Server and third-party tools are examples of applications that are easily able to view and manipulate audit file data. Additionally, applications with user interfaces to audit records should not allow unfettered manipulation of, or access to, those records via any application. If an application provides access to the audit data, the application becomes accountable for ensuring that audit information is protected from unauthorized access.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections, and limiting log data location.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Edit the system security plan to include justification and authorization for any less restrictive permissions that are present and needed.  (An example might be where Auditors need 'Read & Execute' rather than 'Read' alone.)

Modify audit file permissions to meet the requirement to protect against unauthorized access.

Navigate to audit folder location(s) using a command prompt or Windows Explorer. Right-click on the file, click Properties.
On the Security tab, modify the security permissions to:
Administrator(read)
Users (none)
Audit Administrator(Full Control)
Auditors group (Read)
SQL Server Service SID OR Service Account (Full Control) [Notes 1, 2]
SQL Server SQL Agent Service SID OR Service Account, if SQL Server Agent is in use. (Read, Execute, Write) [Notes 1, 2]

-----

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.) For more on this topic, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.120).aspx.

Note 2: Tips for adding a service SID/virtual account to a folder's permission list.
1) In Windows Explorer, right-click on the folder and select 'Properties.'
2) Select the 'Security' tab
3) Click 'Edit'
4) Click 'Add'
5) Click 'Locations'
6) Select the computer name
7) Search for the name

7.a.i) Type 'NT SERVICE\MSSQL' and click 'Check Names'. (What you have just typed in is the first 16 characters of the name. At least one character must follow 'NT SERVICE\'; you will be presented with a list of all matches. If you have typed in the full, correct name, step 7.a.ii is bypassed.)

7.b) SQL Agent Service

          info        : "Under some circumstances, it may be useful to monitor who/what is reading privilege/permission/role information. Therefore, it must be possible to configure auditing to do this. DBMSs typically make such information available through views or functions.

This requirement addresses explicit requests for privilege/permission/role membership information. It does not refer to the implicit retrieval of privileges/permissions/role memberships that the DBMS continually performs to determine if any and every action on the database is permitted.

To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in addition to the successful ones.

Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.

This requirement applies to SQL Server Audit-based audit trails; Trace does not have this capability.

Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all accesses, successful and otherwise, to the system views (and all other schema-scoped objects).  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at all."
