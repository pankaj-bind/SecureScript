  info        : "The System Administrator account, sa, is extremely powerful, having the sa_role,
sso_role, oper_role and Sybase_ts_role by default. Furthermore, the password to the sa
account is blank on install.

Sybase recommends using the sa account only for initial database configuration such as
creating other users, devices and databases. It is then recommended that the sa account is
locked.

The following steps represent best practice handling of the sa account:

. Set a strong password on the sa account; although the sa account should ultimately
be locked, setting a strong password acts as a mitigating step while the database is
being configured or should it be accidently re-enabled. This may have severe
repercussions as the default password for the sa account is blank.
. Create separate user accounts and groups assigning the sa_role, sso_role,
oper_role and sybase_ts_role roles as necessary, following the principle of least
privilege.

. Remove the sa_role, sso_role, oper_role and the sybase_ts_role from the sa
account.
. Lock the sa account

Rationale:

The first attack an intruder is likely to launch against Sybase ASE will be to test whether the
sa account is enabled and whether it has a blank password. If both of these conditions are
true, the attacker has no additional work to do to fully compromise the database.
Furthermore, in many organizations auditing requirements mandate the user of non-
default accounts so that operations can be accurately tracked.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

statement to set a strong password on the sa account (where <StrongPassword>

2. Ensure the above statement returns Password correctly set.

3. Create separate user accounts and groups assigning the sa_role, sso_role,
oper_role and sybase_ts_role roles as necessary, following the principle of least
privilege.

4. Connect to the ASE server as a user with the sso_role and execute the following
SQL statements, ensuring they complete successfully, to strip the sa account of the
sso_role, oper_role and sybase_ts_role roles.

Note that it is essential that other accounts with at least the sa_role and the
sso_role have been created prior to carrying out this and the proceeding step.

revoke role sso_role from 'sa'

revoke role oper_role from 'sa'

revoke role sybase_ts_role from 'sa'

5. Connect to the ASE Server as user with the sa_role and executing the following

sa_role.

Rationale:

full compromise.

Rationale:

Although the database host is likely to be located on the Intranet it may have applications
connecting to it from DMZs and partner networks in addition to the threat of a malicious
user that has valid albeit low privileged domain credentials. Hardening the operating
system will serve the purposes of making it harder for an attacker to compromise the data
within the database via an operating system attack and also harder for an attacker to fully
compromise the host from the database itself.

  description : "6.11 Keep up-to-date with Sybase security patches"
  info        : "Sybase ASE suffers from security vulnerabilities as any large software product invariably
does. Previous publicly documented vulnerabilities have allowed for low privileged users
to execute arbitrary code in the context of the operating system user that the ASE server is
running under.

Updates to Sybase ASE come in the following forms:

. Emergency Bug Fixes (EBFs) are released to correct the flawed component. The
accompanying documentation will typically state the severity of the issue (e.g.
Sybase views this as a mandatory correction that you should implement
immediately).


. Electronic Software Distribution packages (ESDs) are released periodically and
typically contain multiple EBFs and other non-security bug fixes packaged as a
single download, but no additional features. The most recent ESD for a given release
represents the most up-to-date stable version.


. Interim Releases (IRs) are minor releases that introduce new features and
enhancements, incorporating previous ESDs.


. Notification of upcoming patches and possible security threats from third party
components is often announced as an Urgent Notice. Urgent Notices may be
downloaded from the Sybase support site.


Occasionally details of vulnerabilities for which no patch exists may surface on security
mailing lists such as Bugtraq or Full Disclosure. It is therefore recommended that these
lists are regularly monitored. It may be preferable to set up keyword filters for Sybase
since these lists carry a high volume of traffic.


EBFs, ESDs and IRs should be installed in a timely manner subject to your organizations
patching policy and only after they have been fully tested on non-production servers.

Rationale:

It is important to keep up-to-date with patches to ensure the security and integrity of the
data within the database. Privilege escalation vulnerabilities could be used directly via low
privileged users or indirectly via application flaws such as SQL injection to compromise the
database and gain a foothold on the host operating system.
