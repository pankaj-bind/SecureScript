-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.

- Operational security concerns introduced by unmanaged applications/unmanaged personal space, including applications using global positioning system (GPS) tracking.
- Need to ensure no DoD data is saved to the personal space or transmitted from a personal app (for example, from personal email).
- If the Purebred key management app is used, users are responsible for maintaining positive control of their credentialed device at all times. The DoD PKI certificate policy requires subscribers to maintain positive control of the devices that contain private keys and to report any loss of control so the credentials can be revoked. Upon device retirement, turn-in, or reassignment, ensure that a factory data reset is performed prior to device handoff. Follow mobility service provider decommissioning procedures as applicable.
- How to configure the following UBE controls (users must configure the control) on the Motorola device:
 **Secure use of Calendar Alarm.
 **Local screen mirroring and Mirroring procedures (authorized/not authorized for use).
 **Do not upload DoD contacts via smart call and caller ID services.
 **Do not remove DoD intermediate and root PKI digital certificates.
 **Disable Wi-Fi Sharing.
 **Do not configure a DoD network (work) VPN profile on any third-party VPN client installed in the personal space.
 **If Bluetooth connections are approved for mobile device, types of allowed connections (for example car hands free but not Bluetooth wireless keyboard).
- AO guidance on acceptable use and restrictions, if any, on downloading and installing personal apps and data (music, photos, etc.) in the Motorola device personal space.
