          info        : "This requirement focuses on communications protection at the application session, versus network packet, level.

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session.   Applications will make application decisions and execute business logic based on the session ID. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attackers are unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the application must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.

Database sessions must be terminated when no longer in use in order to prevent session hijacking."
          solution    : "Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon user logout.  Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon the occurrence of any organization or policy-defined session termination event.
- - - - -
To configure specific session termination processes we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event.  Below are some examples.

Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.

You can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with 'alter profile' statements:

alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit
   connect_time 180000
   sessions_per_user 2
   ldle_time 1800;

Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when you create users, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.

The syntax to create a profile follows:

CREATE PROFILE  LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters:
 [SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [CPU_PER_SESSION   n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [CPU_PER_CALL      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [CONNECT_TIME      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [IDLE_TIME         n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, you can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. You can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session-level, the call level, or both. The session-level is calculated from the time the user logs in to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If you need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), you should set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit your sqlnet.ora file.  If you are a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local > Profile.

From the list on the right hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.

Next, enter the values for the fields or options you want to set.

When you are finished, choose File > Save Network Configuration to write your changes to the sqlnet.ora file.

(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use.  Please see the supplemental file 'Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf' for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.

To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, you should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.)  Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error."

When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.

In the event emergency application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts that are designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.  Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or application data compromised.

Note: User authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

If it is possible for any temporary emergency accounts to be created and managed by Oracle, then the DBMS or application must provide or utilize a mechanism to automatically terminate such accounts after an organization-defined time period.

Emergency database accounts must be automatically terminated after an organization-defined time period in order to mitigate the risk of the account being misused.

Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who you do not want to have access to the AUD$ table.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:
    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and you want to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that you use for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees


SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED;

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list]

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* )

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. You can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

You can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: You cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.
routine-designator

  {
   qualified-name [ signature ]
  }

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends on is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if you have other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see 'SQL standard authorization' in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges
    All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges
    Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Revoke examples
To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry

To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi

To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax:
SQL>REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT"

    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and you want to revoke that access use the following command. The syntax that you use for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees


SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED;

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list]

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* )

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. You can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

You can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: You cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.
routine-designator

  {
   qualified-name [ signature ]
  }

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends on is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if you have other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see 'SQL standard authorization' in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges
    All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges
    Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Revoke examples
To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry

To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi

To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL>REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax:
SQL>REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT"

Roles and Profiles are two Oracle features that should be employed in account management. (Indeed, other requirements mandate the use of Roles.) Following are some notes from Oracle on the use of Profiles.

A profile is a named set of resource limits and password parameters that restrict database usage and instance resources for a user. You can assign a profile to each user, and a default profile to all others. Each user can have only one profile, and creating a new one supersedes any earlier one.

Profile resource limits are enforced only when you enable resource limitation for the associated database. Enabling such limitation can occur either before starting up the database (the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter) or while it is open (using an ALTER SYSTEM statement).

While password parameters reside in profiles, they are unaffected by RESOURCE_LIMIT or ALTER SYSTEM and password management is always enabled."

CREATE USER TEMP001 IDENTIFIED BY PassWord#TEMP01 PROFILE TEMPORARY_USERS;

Resource Parameters:

SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to which you want to limit the user.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - See Oracle documentation for more details.

Password Parameters:

Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes you can specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log in to the user account before the account is locked.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If you also set a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If you omit this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, you must specify an integer for both of them.

If you specify an integer for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if you specify PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If you specify an integer for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If you specify DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If you have not changed the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

If you set both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if you omit both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If you omit this clause, then the default is 1 day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If you omit this clause, then the default is 7 days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but you can create your own routine or use third-party software instead."

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document.

Group authentication does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users.

When group accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.


This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered."
