      info             : "SNMP v3 can be used for remote logging, and is the recommended protocol in higher security situations as it fully supports encryption of logs.

Rationale:

Sending all system logs to a remote host is recommended to provide protected, long term storage and archiving. This also places a copy of the logs in a second location, in case the primary (on the firewall) logs are compromised. Storing logs on a remote host also allows for more flexible log searches and log processing, as well as many methods of triggering events or scripts based on specific log events or combinations of events. Finally, remote logging provides many organizations with the opportunity to combine logs from disparate infrastructure in a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

Logging to an external system is also usually required by most regulatory frameworks.

Impact:

Failure to properly store and archive logs for critical infrastructure leaves an organization without the tools required to establish trends in events or activity, or to retrospectively analyze security or operational events beyond the log timespan stored on the firewall. Not having remote logs also puts many organizations outside of compliance with many regulatory frameworks. Finally, not logging to a remote host leaves organizations without recourse in the event of a compromise of logs on the primary device. It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact. Not encrypting log data as it transits the network allows an attacker to mount a 'MiTM' (Monkey in the Middle) attack, which allows them to intercept and/or modify logs as they transit from the source to the destination."

      info             : "SNMP v3 can be used for remote logging, and is the recommended protocol in higher security situations as it fully supports encryption of logs.

Rationale:

Sending all system logs to a remote host is recommended to provide protected, long term storage and archiving. This also places a copy of the logs in a second location, in case the primary (on the firewall) logs are compromised. Storing logs on a remote host also allows for more flexible log searches and log processing, as well as many methods of triggering events or scripts based on specific log events or combinations of events. Finally, remote logging provides many organizations with the opportunity to combine logs from disparate infrastructure in a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

Logging to an external system is also usually required by most regulatory frameworks.

Impact:

Failure to properly store and archive logs for critical infrastructure leaves an organization without the tools required to establish trends in events or activity, or to retrospectively analyze security or operational events beyond the log timespan stored on the firewall. Not having remote logs also puts many organizations outside of compliance with many regulatory frameworks. Finally, not logging to a remote host leaves organizations without recourse in the event of a compromise of logs on the primary device. It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact. Not encrypting log data as it transits the network allows an attacker to mount a 'MiTM' (Monkey in the Middle) attack, which allows them to intercept and/or modify logs as they transit from the source to the destination."

      info             : "The Certificate used to secure Remote Access VPNs should satisfy the following criteria:

It should be a valid certificate from a trusted source. In almost cases this means a trusted Public Certificate Authority, as in most cases remote access VPN users will not have access to any Private Certificate Authorities for Certificate validation.

The certificate should have a valid date. It should not have a 'to' date in the past (it should not be expired), and should not have a 'from' date in the future.

The key length used to encrypt the certificate should be 2048 bits or more.

The hash used to sign the certificate should be SHA-2 or better.

When the Certificate is applied, the TLS version should be 1.1 or higher (1.2 is recommended)

Rationale:

If presented with a certificate error, the end user in most cases will not be able to tell if their session is using a self-signed or expired certificate, or if their session is being eavesdropped on or injected into by a 'Man in the Middle' attack. This means that self-signed or invalid certificates should never be used for VPN connections.

Impact:

Not using a trusted Certificate, issued by a trusted Public Certificate Authority means that clients establishing VPN sessions will always see an error indicating an untrusted Certificate. This means that they will have no method of validating if their VPN session is being hijacked by a 'Monkey in the Middle' (MitM) attack. It also 'trains' them to bypass certificate warnings for other services, making MitM attacks easier for those other services as well."

Rationale:

WMI probing normally requires a domain administrator account. A malicious user could capture the encrypted password hash for offline cracking or relayed authentication attacks. Relying on other forms of user identification, such as using UserID Agents or security log monitoring, mitigates this risk.

In addition, it is easy to mis-configure this feature such that it is enabled on untrusted interfaces. This can result in a domain administrator account and the associated password hash being sent to untrusted hosts on the internet, where malicious users can then capture that hash for offline cracking.

Impact:

While this removes the exposure of having the WMI user account password being compromised, it also reduces the effectiveness of user identification during operation of the firewall (applying rules and policies). This trade-off should be weighed carefully for all installations."

The Alert, Activate, and Maximum settings for Flood Protection depend highly on the environment and device used. Perform traffic analysis on the specific environment and firewall to determine accurate thresholds. Do not rely on default values to be appropriate for an environment.

Setting these values for all interfaces is an approach that should be considered by many organizations, as traffic floods can result from internal testing or malware as well.

Rationale:

Without flood protection, it may be possible for an attacker, through the use of a botnet or other means, to overwhelm network resources. Flood protection does not completely eliminate this risk; rather, it provides a layer of protection. Without a properly configured zone protection profile applied to untrusted interfaces, the protected / trusted networks are susceptible to large number of attacks. While many of these involve denial of service, some of these attacks are designed to evade IPS systems (fragmentation attacks for instance) or to evade basic firewall protections (source routing and record route attacks).

Impact:

Not configuring and applying a Network Zone Protection Profile leaves an organization exposed to common attacks and reconnaissance from untrusted networks.

Not configuring a Zone Protection Profile for internal networks leaves an organization vulnerable to malware, software or hardware causes of traffic flooding from internal sources."

      info             : "When permitting traffic from an untrusted zone, such as the Internet or guest network, to a more trusted zone, such as a DMZ segment, create security policies specifying which specific applications are allowed.

**Enhanced Security Recommendation: ** Require specific application policies when allowing any traffic, regardless of the trust level of a zone. Do not rely solely on port permissions. This may require SSL interception, and may also not be possible in all environments.

Rationale:

To avoid unintentionally exposing systems and services, rules allowing traffic from untrusted zones to trusted zones should be as specific as possible. Application-based rules, as opposed to service/port rules, further tighten what traffic is allowed to pass. Similarly, traffic from trusted to untrusted networks should have a security policy set, with application-based rules. A 'catch-all' rule that allows all applications will also allow malware traffic. The goal should be to understand both inbound and outbound traffic, permit what is known, and block all other traffic.

Impact:

Setting application based rules on both inbound and outbound traffic ensures that the traffic on the protocol and port being specified is actually the application that you expect. For outbound traffic, the days of 'we trust our users' is well past us, that statement also implies that we trust the malware on the user workstations, which is obviously not the case.
For traffic from trusted to less trusted interfaces, the applications should be characterized over time, with the end goal being that all applications in in the rules, and a final 'block all' rule is in place. Not having this goal gives both attackers and malware the leeway they need to accomplish their goals.
Trusting only Port permissions to control traffic exposes an organization to 'tunneling' style attacks that can exfiltrate data or facilitate Command and Control (C2) sessions.

1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or 'IoT' (Internet of Things) devices.

2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as 'Visitors' in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of 'visitor' traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.

Rationale:

Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's 'man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type.
