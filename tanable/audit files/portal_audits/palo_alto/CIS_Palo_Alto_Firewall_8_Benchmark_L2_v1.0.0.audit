      info             : "In most cases, a browser HTTPS interface is used to administer the Palo Alto appliance. The certificate used to secure this session should satisfy the following criteria:
1. A valid certificate from a trusted source should be used. While a certificate from a trusted Public Certificate Authority is certainly valid, one from a trusted Private Certificate Authority is absolutely acceptable for this purpose.
2. The certificate should have a valid date. It should not have a \"to\" date in the past (it should not be expired), and should not have a \"from\" date in the future.
3. The certificate should use an acceptable cipher and encryption level.
Rationale:
If a certificate that is self-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid is used for the browser HTTPS interface, administrators in most cases will not be able to tell if their session is being eavesdropped on or injected into by a \"Man in the Middle\" attack.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution         : "If a new administrative certificate is needed, acquire a certificate that meets the stated criteria and set it:
Optional: Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificates
Import an appropriate Certificate for your administrative session, from a trusted Certificate Authority.
Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > SSL/TLS Service Profile
Choose or import the certificate you want to use for the web based administrative session.
Navigate to 'Device > Setup > Management > General Settings > SSL/TLS Service Profile'
Choose the Service Profile that you have configured
Impact:
If the default self-signed certificate is used, an administrator will not be able to clearly tell if their HTTPS session is being hijacked or not. Using a trusted certificate ensures that the session is both encrypted and trusted.
Default Value:
A self-signed certificate is installed by default for the administrative interface."

Rationale:
WMI probing normally requires a domain administrator account. A malicious user could capture the encrypted password hash for offline cracking or relayed authentication attacks. Relying on other forms of user identification, such as security log monitoring, mitigates this risk."
      solution         : "Navigate to Device > User Identification > User Mapping > Palo Alto Networks User ID Agent Setup.
Set Enable Probing so it is unchecked.
Impact:
While this removes the exposure of having the WMI user account password being compromised, it also reduces the effectiveness of user identification during operation of the firewall (applying rules and policies). This trade-off should be weighed carefully for all installations.

Enable all Flood Protection options in the Zone Protection Profile attached to all untrusted zones. The Alert, Activate, and Maximum settings for Flood Protection depend highly on the environment and device used. Perform traffic analysis on the specific environment and firewall to determine accurate thresholds. Do not rely on default values to be appropriate for an environment.
Setting these values for all interfaces is an approach that should be considered by many organizations, as traffic floods can result from internal testing or malware as well.
Rationale:
Without flood protection, it may be possible for an attacker, through the use of a botnet or other means, to overwhelm network resources. Flood protection does not completely eliminate this risk; rather, it provides a layer of protection. Without a properly configured zone protection profile applied to untrusted interfaces, the protected / trusted networks are susceptible to large number of attacks. While many of these involve denial of service, some of these attacks are designed to evade IPS systems (fragmentation attacks for instance) or to evade basic firewall protections (source routing and record route attacks)."

Rationale:
To avoid unintentionally exposing systems and services, rules allowing traffic from untrusted zones to trusted zones should be as specific as possible. Application-based rules, as opposed to service/port rules, further tighten what traffic is allowed to pass. Similarly, traffic from trusted to untrusted networks should have a security policy set, with application-based rules. A \"catch-all\" rule that allows all applications will also allow malware traffic. The goal should be to understand both inbound and outbound traffic, permit what is known, and block all other traffic.

Impact:
Setting application based rules on both inbound and outbound traffic ensures that the traffic on the protocol and port being specified is actually the application that you expect. For outbound traffic, the days of \"we trust our users\" is well past us, that statement also implies that we trust the malware on the user workstations, which is obviously not the case.
For traffic from trusted to less trusted interfaces, the applications should be characterized over time, with the end goal being that all applications in in the rules, and a final \"block all\" rule is in place. Not having this goal gives both attackers and malware the leeway they need to accomplish their goals.

1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) devices.
2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as \"Visitors\" in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of \"visitor\" traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for members organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.
Rationale:
Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's \"man in the middle' certificate.
