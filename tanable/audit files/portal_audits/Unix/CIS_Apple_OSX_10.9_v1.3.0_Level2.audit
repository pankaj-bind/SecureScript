      info        : "Apple's iCloud is a consumer oriented service that allows a user to store data as well as find, control and backup devices that are associated with their Apple ID (Apple account.) The use of iCloud on Enterprise devices should align with the acceptable use policy for devices that are managed as well as confidentiality requirements for data handled by the user. If iCloud is allowed the data that is copied to Apple servers will likely be duplicated on both personal as well as Enterprise devices. For many users the Enterprise email system may replace many of the available features in iCloud. If using either an Exchange or Google environment email, calendars, notes and contacts can sync to the official Enterprise repository and be available through multiple devices. Depending on workplace requirements it may not be appropriate to intermingle Enterprise and personal bookmarks, photos and documents. Since the service allows every device associated with the users ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers but having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee. The use of family sharing options can reduce the risk. The remote connectivity of \"Back to My Mac\" relies on screen sharing that should already be turned off, if available the users Apple ID (personal?) can be used for remote access to the Enterprise computer rather than through Enterprise managed accounts. Apple's iCloud is just one of many cloud based solutions being used for data synchronization across multiple platforms and it should be controlled consistently with other cloud services in your environment. Work with your employees and configure the access to best enable data protection for you mission.

      info        : "EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load Mac OS X from, it also determines whether the user can enter single-user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode and protection against firewire DMA attacks. In the past it was not difficult to reset the firmware password by removing RAM but it did make tampering slightly harder and having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to Manage the firmware password on OS X computers, though some tools did make it much easier. Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses Single User Mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive. Starting in Late 2010 with the MacBook Air Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used. Setting the firmware password may be good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time. http://support.apple.com/kb/ts3554 https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=58 http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/protecting-yourself-against-firewire-dma-attacks-on-10-7-x/ http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/booting-into-single-user-mode-on-a-filevault-2-encrypted-mac/.
