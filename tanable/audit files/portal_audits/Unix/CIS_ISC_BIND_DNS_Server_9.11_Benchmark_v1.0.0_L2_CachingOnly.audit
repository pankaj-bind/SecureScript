      description : "1.4 Use Secure Upstream Caching DNS Servers"
      info        : "Caching name servers often forward queries to another caching name server to allow the name service work to be aggregated and improve performance by taking advantage of the cache of an upstream name server. The default caching name server provided by the Internet service provider is often used in this manner. This may also be a security weakness by relying on insecure servers outside the organization's control and security policies.

Rationale:

The security of all of the external connections that your systems on your network depend in part on getting accurate IP addresses for external names. If the upstream caching name server is compromised, or has its cache poisoned with malicious records, then your entire network may be subject to an attack which may redirect web, email, or VPN traffic to malicious servers, or may cause denial of services attacks. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the security of the upstream caching name servers to reduce the risk of DNS attacks propagated to your network via the upstream provider. There are a number of security companies that offer secure caching DNS services that are worth considering. Features to look for and test include:

Blocking of traffic to websites known to contain malware.

Configurable categories for blocking inappropriate content, such as adult content.

Detecting and blocking of malware communications to an external command and control server.

Prevent DNS spoofing by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of all DNS responses.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Perform the following for remediation:

Select an external DNS provider that sufficiently mitigates malicious DNS traffic to meet your organizational requirements.

Review network architectural, approved internal DNS servers, and prepare to block outbound DNS traffic, except to the approved DNS servers from the internal caching name servers.

Review, test and document the approved external DNS servers.

Configure the internal caching-only DNS servers to forward queries to the approved external caching DNS server. The forwarders directive similar to the example below may be placed in the server options directive.

        forwarders { acl_of_approved_servers; };

Block outbound DNS traffic, except to the approved external DNS servers from the internal caching name servers."

      description : "2.9 Isolate BIND with chroot'ed Subdirectory"
      info        : "The chroot() system call causes an application to run with limited file system access so that a subdirectory becomes the root directory for the application environment. When this is done, the application is 'jailed' and no longer has access to the entire file structure but is limited to the given subdirectory.

The chroot'd subdirectory and the recommendations in section 'Enable SELinux to Restrict BIND Processes' provide similar controls, in that the DNS service is prevented from accessing and modifying inappropriate files. SELinux goes well beyond what the chroot is able to prevent, however for audit purposes either control, the chroot'd subdirectory or the SELinux in enforcing mode is sufficient.

Rationale:

Although there are ways that a chroot jail can be broken, most methods require that a process be running as root in order to escape. Since BIND should be run as a different user than root, a chroot is an effective defense, to limit access to sensitive system configuration files. In the event that BIND has a vulnerability that allows code execution, the attack will not have access to the real system files such as /etc/password, but will be limited to the files placed in the chroot subdirectory."
      solution    : "Perform the following:

Stop the named service and install the bind-chroot package to provide the chroot directories.

# systemctl stop named.service
# yum install bind-chroot

Edit the /etc/sysconfig/named configuration file to have a line similar to the one shown below that sets the ROOTDIR environment variable.

ROOTDIR='/var/named/chroot'

Move all the configuration files and any master zone files into their respective directions under the subdirectory /var/named/chroot/

It may be helpful to create symbolic links from a couple of system /etc files such as /etc/named.conf and /etc/rndc.key to the real files in the chroot'ed subdirectory, so that utilities like rndc will work as expected. Do not create symbolic links or hard links from inside the chroot to external resources! Instead use symbolic links to point from the outside resources into the chroot.

Restart the named service and test the configuration.

# systemctl start named.service

Default Value:

The BIND service is not chroot'ed by default."

      description : "10.2 Ensure BIND Processes Run in the named_t Confined Context Type"
      info        : "SELinux includes customizable targeted policies that may be used to confine the BIND named server to enforce least privileges so that the server has only the minimal access to specified directories, files and network ports. Access is controlled by process types (domains) defined for the named process. There are about a dozen related types defined in a default named SELinux policy. The default SELinux policies work well for a default BIND installation, however testing of the SELinux polices with the specific BIND operations is highly recommended. All directories and files to be accessed by the named server process must have security labels with appropriate types. The following file context types are a sample of the most commonly used:

named_cache_t - Directories and files with dynamically updated contents

named_conf_t - Directories and Configuration files to be read, but not updated

named_exec_t - BIND related Executables

The seinfo may be used list the types that are configured. For example, the following will list the relevant types that begin with named_

# seinfo -t | grep ' named_'

The semanage fcontext command may be used to list file context mapping. For example:

# semanage fcontext -l | grep ':named_'

Rationale:

With the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the BIND named server may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by SELinux because the inappropriate files are not labeled with necessary named specific context. Likewise writing to an unexpected directory or execution of unexpected content can be prevented by similar mandatory security labels enforced by SELinux."
      solution    : "If the running named process is not confined to the named_t SELinux context. Then check the labeled context for the named binaries and set the binary files to have a context of named_exec_t as shown below. The named-checkconf executable should have named_checkconf_exec_t type.

# ls -Z  /usr/sbin/named /usr/sbin/named-checkconf /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor
          system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/named
system_u:object_r:named_checkconf_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/named-checkconf
          system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0 /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor

If the executable files are not labeled correctly, they may be relabeled with the chcon command, as shown, however the file system labeling is based on the SELinux file context mapping polices and the file systems will on some occasions be relabeled according to the policy.

# chcon -t named_exec_t /usr/sbin/named /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor
# chcon -t named_checkconf_exec_t /usr/sbin/named-checkconf

Since the file system may be relabeled based on SELinux policy, it's best to check the SELinux policy with semanage fcontext -l option. If the policy is not present, then add the pattern to the policy using the --add option. The restorecon command shown below will restore the file context label according to the current policy, which is required if a pattern was added.

# ### Check the Policy
# semanage fcontext -l | grep '/usr/sbin/named*'
/usr/sbin/named            regular file system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0
/usr/sbin/named-checkconf  regular file system_u:object_r:named_checkconf_exec_t:
s0

# semanage fcontext -l | grep /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor
/usr/sbin/unbound-anchor   regular file system_u:object_r:named_exec_t:s0

# ### Add to the policy, if not present
# semanage fcontext --add -f f -t named_exec_t /usr/sbin/named
# semanage fcontext --add -f f -t named_exec_t /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor
# semanage fcontext --add -f f -t named_checkconf_exec_t /usr/sbin/named-checkconf

# ### Restore the file labeling accord to the SELinux policy
# restorecon -v /usr/sbin/named /usr/sbin/named-checkconf /usr/sbin/unbound-anchor

Restarting the BIND named service will also be required.

Default Value:

Usage of the permissive mode is helpful for testing and ensuring that SELinux will not prevent access that is necessary for the proper function of the DNS server. However, inappropriate access will not be prevented in permissive mode by SELinux."
      solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

If the named_t type is in permissive mode; the customized permissive mode should be deleted with the following semanage command.

# semanage permissive -d named_t

Default Value:

The named_t type is not in permissive mode by default."

      description : "10.4 Ensure Only the Necessary SELinux Booleans are Enabled"
      info        : "SELinux booleans allow or disallow specific behaviors. There are two boolean variables specific to the ISC BIND DNS server:

named_tcp_bind_http_port - Allow named to tcp bind http port

named_write_master_zones - Allow named to write master zones

The named_tcp_bind_http_port would allow enabling the BIND statistics http channel which is not recommended. The named_write_master_zones allows BIND to update the master files, which is necessary when dynamic updates are performed, or the server is automatically maintaining DNSSEC digital signatures.

Rationale:

Enabling only the necessary named related booleans provides a defense in depth approach, that will deny actions that are not in use or expected."
      solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

Disable the SELinux boolean using the setsebool command as shown below with the -P option to make the change persistent.

# setsebool -P named_tcp_bind_http_port off

Default Value:

The default value for named_tcp_bind_http_port is off."
