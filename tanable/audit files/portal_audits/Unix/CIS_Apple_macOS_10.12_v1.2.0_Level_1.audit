Rationale:

Bluetooth is particularly susceptible to a diverse set of security vulnerabilities involving identity detection, location tracking, denial of service, unintended control and access of data and voice channels, and unauthorized device control and data access.

Impact:

There have been many Bluetooth exploits, while Bluetooth can be hardened it does create a local wireless network that can be attacked to compromise both devices and information. Apple has emphasized the ease of use in Bluetooth devices so it is generally expected that Bluetooth will be used.

Rationale:

Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.

macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.




Impact:

The SSH server built-in to macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications including email, web browser and productivity tools should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH, if they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.

For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:

Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks, this is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.

Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.

Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark"

      info        : "One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a time machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.

While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.

Rationale:

Backup volumes need to be encrypted

In cases where sensitive and protected data is processed and Siri could help a user navigate their machine and expose that information it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of it's requirements.

Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity. Where 'normal' user activity is already limited Siri use should be controlled as well.

The benefit of not leaving the computer unlocked while the user is out of sight and readying the computer to resume work when the user returns without having to type in a password or insert a smartcard does seem attractive to people who have the Apple Watch. It is a continuation of other features like hand-off and continuity for the multiple Apple products users who have grown to expect their devices to work together.

For the screen unlock capability in particular it may not be attractive to organizations that are managing Apple devices and credentials. The capability allows a user to unlock their computer tied to an Enterprise account with a personal token that is not managed or controlled by the Enterprise. If the user loses their watch revoking the credential that can unlock the screen might be problematic.

Unless Enterprise control of the watch as a token tied to a user identity can be achieved Apple Watches should not be used for screen unlocks. The risk of an auto-lock based on the user being out of proximity may still be acceptable if possible to do lock only.

This functionality does require the computer to be logged in to iCloud. If iCloud is disabled the Apple watch lock and unlock will not be possible.

A profile may be used to control unlock functionality.

Filesystem formatting and manipulation is only available in the command line and not the GUI and there are some reported gaps with the encryption capabilities. Until the filesystem supports boot volumes, FileVault, OS integrated encryption and key management as well as GUI management it should not be used with production systems.

It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to macOS or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.

In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.

Even with all of these positives some environments may wish to disable AirDrop. Organizations where Bluetooth and Wireless are not used will disable AirDrop by blocking it's necessary interfaces. Organizations that have disabled USB and other pluggable storage mechanisms and have blocked all unmanaged cloud and transfer solutions for DLP may want to disable AirDrop as well.

AirDrop should be used with Contacts only to limit attacks.
