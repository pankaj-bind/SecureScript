      info        : "Enable user namespace support in Docker daemon to utilize container user to host user re-mapping. This recommendation is beneficial where containers you are using do not have an explicit container user definedin the container image. If container images that you are using have a pre-defined non-root user, this recommendation may be skipped since this feature is still in its infancy and might give you unpredictable issues and complexities.

Rationale:

The Linux kernel user namespace support in Docker daemon provides additional security for the Docker host system. It allows a container to have a unique range of user and group IDs which are outside the traditional user and group range utilized by the host system.

For example, the root user will have expected administrative privilege inside the container but can effectively be mapped to an unprivileged UID on the host system.
NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Please consult Docker documentation for various ways in which this can be configured depending upon your requirements. Your steps might also vary based on platform - For example, on Red Hat, sub-UIDs and sub-GIDs mapping creation does not work automatically. You might have to create your own mapping.



However, the high-level steps are as below:

Step 1: Ensure that the files/etc/subuidand /etc/subgid exist.

touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid

Step 2: Start the docker daemon with --userns-remap flag

dockerd --userns-remap=default

Impact:

User namespace remapping makes quite a few Docker features incompatible and also currently breaks a few functionalities. Check out the Docker documentation and referenced links for details.

Default Value:

By default, user namespace is not remapped."

Rationale:

System administrators typically define cgroups under which containers are supposed to run. Even if cgroups are not explicitly defined by the system administrators, containers run under docker cgroup by default.

It is possible to attach to a different cgroup other than that is the default. This usage should be monitored and confirmed. By attaching to a different cgroup than the one that is a default, it is possible to share resources unevenly and thus might starve the host for resources."

For Example,

dockerd --cgroup-parent=/foobar

None.

Rationale:

The base device size can be increased at daemon restart. Increasing the base device size allows all future images and containers to be of the new base device size.A user can use this option to expand the base device size however shrinking is not permitted. This value affects the system-wide base empty filesystem that may already be initialized and inherited by pulled images.

Though the file system does not allot the increased size if it is empty, it will use more space for the empty case depending upon the device size. This may cause a denial of service by ending up in file system being over-allocated or full.

Rationale:

Dockers out-of-the-box authorization model is all or nothing. Any user with permission to access the Docker daemon can run any Docker client command. The same is true for callers using Dockers remote API to contact the daemon. If you require greater access control, you can create authorization plugins and add them to your Docker daemon configuration. Using an authorization plugin, a Docker administrator can configure granular access policies for managing access to Docker daemon."

In an environment where DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST is set, you are required to follow trust procedures while working with images - build, create, pull, push and run. You can use the --disable-content-trust flag to run individual operations on tagged images without content trust on an as-needed basis but that defeats the purpose of enabling content trust and hence, should be avoided wherever possible.

setuidandsetgid permissions could be used for elevating privileges. While these permissions are at times legitimately needed, these could potentially be used in privilege escalation attacks.

      description : "5.22 Do not docker exec commands with privileged option"
      info        : "Do not docker exec with --privileged option.

Rationale:

Using --privileged option in docker exec gives extended Linux capabilities to the command. This could potentially be insecure and unsafe to do especially when you are running containers with dropped capabilities or with enhanced restrictions.
NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Do not use --privileged option in docker exec command.

Impact:

None. If you need enhanced capabilities within the container, then run the container with the needed capabilities.

Default Value:

By default, docker exec command runs without --privileged option."

      description : "5.23 Do not docker exec commands with user option"

Rationale:

Using --user option in docker exec executes the command within the container as that user. This could potentially be insecure and unsafe to do especially when you are running containers with dropped capabilities or with enhanced restrictions.

For example, suppose your container is running as tomcat user (or any other non-root user), it would be possible to run a command through docker exec as root with --user=root option. This could potentially be dangerous.
NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

None.

      info        : "Do not use Docker's default bridge docker0. Use docker's user-defined networks for container networking.

Rationale:

Docker connects virtual interfaces created in the bridge mode to a common bridge called docker0. This default networking model is vulnerable to ARP spoofing and MAC flooding attacks since there is no filtering applied.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Impact:

You have to manage the user-defined networks.

By default, docker runs containers on its docker0 bridge."
