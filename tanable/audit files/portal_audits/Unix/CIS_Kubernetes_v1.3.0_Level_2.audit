Rationale:

etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. Its access should be restricted to specifically designated clients and peers only.

Authentication to etcd is based on whether the certificate presented was issued by a trusted certificate authority. There is no checking of certificate attributes such as common name or subject alternative name. As such, if any attackers were able to gain access to any certificate issued by the trusted certificate authority, they would be able to gain full access to the etcd database.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Then, edit the etcd pod specification file '/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml' on the master node and set the below parameter.

Rationale:

Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. 'NetworkPolicy' resources use labels to select pods and define whitelist rules which allow traffic to the selected pods in addition to what is allowed by the isolation policy for a given namespace.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

          info        : "Enable 'docker/default' seccomp profile in your pod definitions.

Rationale:

Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
          solution    : "Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing '--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true' argument.

Edit the '/etc/kubernetes/apiserver' file on the master node and set the 'KUBE_API_ARGS' parameter to '--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true'

KUBE_API_ARGS='--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true'

Based on your system, restart the 'kube-apiserver' service. For example:

systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service

Use 'annotations' to enable the 'docker/default' seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An example is as below:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: trustworthy-pod
 annotations:
 seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default
spec:
 containers:
 - name: trustworthy-container
 image: sotrustworthy:latest

Impact:

If the 'docker/default' seccomp profile is too restrictive for you, you would have to create/manage your own seccomp profiles. Also, you need to enable all alpha features for this to work. There is no individual switch to turn on this feature."

Rationale:

A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context.

Rationale:

The Network Policy API is now stable. Network policy, implemented through a network plug-in, allows users to set and enforce rules governing which pods can communicate with each other. You should leverage it as appropriate in your environment.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
          solution    : "Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup network policies as appropriate.

For example, you could create a 'default' isolation policy for a Namespace by creating a NetworkPolicy that selects all pods but does not allow any traffic:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
 name: default-deny
spec:
 podSelector:

Impact:

You need to regularly maintain your network policies and design them carefully. Also, network policies v1 support depends on your CNI. Carefully choose your CNI."

          info          : "Do not generally permit containers with potentially dangerous capabilities.

Rationale:

Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. By default with Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers.

Ideally, all containers should drop this capability.

There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers with the NET_RAW capability from launching.

If you need to run containers with this capability, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP."
          solution      : "Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the .spec.requiredDropCapabilities is set to include either NET_RAW or ALL.

Impact:

Pods with containers which run with the NET_RAW capability will not be permitted."
