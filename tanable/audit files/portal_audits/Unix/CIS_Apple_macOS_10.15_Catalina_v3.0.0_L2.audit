      description : "1.8 Ensure Computer Name Does Not Contain PII or Protected Organizational Information"
      info        : "If the computer is used in an organization that assigns host names, it is a good idea to change the computer name to the host name. This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily.

For organizations or for users that self-administer their own computers, it is important to not use sensitive or personal information in computer names. The name of a computer that uses untrusted networks will be exposed at a minimum to the responsible network team of that network. While I may not care if the computer name of Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro is visible on a Hooters WiFi network, other uses may not feel the same way.

Examples of possibly inappropriate content in computer names include:

User directory account names

Computer directory account names where machine accounts exist

Contact phone numbers

Physical locations of offices or residences

Personal information that can be augmented with Facebook data to assist social engineering attacks

Standard naming patterns avoid collisions and mitigate risk for computer users.

With mobile devices, using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks; hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it. If the computer is using different names for the 'Computer Name' DNS and Directory environments, it can be difficult to manage Macs in an Enterprise asset inventory.

Rationale:

Part of IT security is having visibility into all of the devices for which an organization is responsible. Without a complete inventory, it is impossible to ensure all security controls are met on all organizational devices.

Default macOS naming deconfliction controls can create issues for appropriate management and tracking as well as privacy exposure. By default, the name of a macOS computer is derived from the first user created. If the user has multiple computers or an image is used without an appropriate name change, there will be multiple computers with names derived from the same user for discovery deconfliction. How many 'Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro' should there be, and are any missing?

Local network auto renaming to avoid collisions also allows for the enumeration of local computer names. Computers should not be named after their users, especially on untrusted networks. For social engineering purposes, the computer name should not provide a full name of the user or an identifiable name that might be used to assist in targeted user attacks.

A documented plan to better enable a complete device inventory without exposing user or organizational information is part of mature security.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Rationale:

The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks.

They do not need to specify their location for weather or travel times, and they will receive alerts on travel times to meetings and appointment where location information is supplied.

Location Services simplify some processes with mobile computers, such as asset management and time or log management.

There are some use cases where it is important that the computer not be able to report its exact location. While the general use case is to enable Location Services, it should not be allowed if the physical location of the computer and the user should not be public knowledge.

Rationale:

Location Services are helpful in most use cases and can simplify log and time management where computers change time zones."
      solution     : "Graphical Method:
Perform the following steps to enable Location Services:

Open System Preferences

Select Security & Privacy

Select Privacy

Set Enable Location Services to enabled

Terminal Method:
Run the following command to enable Location Services:

$ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locationd.plist

If the com.apple.locationd.plist outputs 0, run the following command to also ensure Location Services is running:

$ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /var/db/locationd/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.locationd LocationServicesEnabled -bool false

$ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl kickstart -k system/com.apple.locationd

Note: In some use cases, organizations may not want Location Services running. To disable Location Services, System Integrity Protection must be disabled."

      info        : "macOS uses location information gathered through local Wi-Fi networks to enable applications to supply relevant information to users. While Location Services may be very useful, it may not be desirable to allow all applications that can use Location Services to use your location for Internet queries in order to provide tailored content based on your current location.

Ensure applications that can use Location Services are authorized and provide that information where the application interacts with external systems. Apple offers feedback within System Preferences and may be enabled to supply information on the menu bar when Location Services are used.

Safari can deny access from websites or prompt for access.

Applications that support Location Services can be individually controlled in the Privacy tab in Security & Privacy under System Preferences.

Access should be evaluated to ensure that privacy controls are as expected.

Rationale:

Privacy controls should be monitored for appropriate settings.

Impact:

Many macOS features rely on Location Services for tailored information. Users expect their time zone and weather to be relevant to where they are without manual intervention. Find my Mac needs to know where your Mac is actually located. Where possible, the tolerance between location privacy and convenience may be best left to the user when the location itself is not sensitive. If facility locations are not public, location information should be tightly controlled.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

One of the concerns in public cloud storage is that proprietary data may be inappropriately stored in an end user's personal repository. Organizations that need specific controls on information should ensure that this service is turned off or the user knows what information must be stored on services that are approved for storage of controlled information.

Rationale:

Organizations should review third party storage solutions pertaining to existing data confidentiality and integrity requirements.

Impact:

Users will not be able to use continuity on macOS to resume the use of newly composed but unsaved files.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

This capability mirrors what Microsoft is doing with the use of OneDrive and Office 365. There are concerns with using this capability.

The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras, and all iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more, storage may be tight using the free 5GB provided without purchasing much larger storage capacity from Apple. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well.

Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations, such as iCloud Drive or DropBox, the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files.

When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available.

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.

MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.

MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

              info        : "In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.

MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

              info        : "In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.

MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

              description : "2.8.3 Ensure the OS is not Activate When Resuming from Sleep - Apple DestroyFVKeyOnStandby"
              info        : "In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.

MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

          info        : "In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.

If an unauthorized party has possession of the computer and the computer is only slept, there are known attack vectors that can be attempted against the RAM that has the encryption keys or the running operating system protected by a login screen. Network attacks if network interfaces are on, as well as USB or other open device ports, are possible. Most of these attacks require knowledge of unpatched vulnerabilities or a high level of sophistication if all the other controls function as intended.

There is little impact on hibernating the system rather than sleeping after an appropriate time period to remediate the risk of OS level attacks. Hibernation writes the keys to disk and requires FileVault to be unlocked prior to the OS being available. In the case of unauthorized personnel with access to the computer, encryption would have to be broken prior to attacking the operating system in order to recover data from the system.

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for 'standbydelay' is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.

MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into system when it resumes.

MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

Rationale:

To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.

Impact:

The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation then if only sleeping rather than hibernating."

Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised.

Depending on the governing authority, organizations can have vastly different auditing requirements. In this control we have selected a minimal set of audit flags that should be a part of any organizational requirements.

      info        : "With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple added a new application, App Store, which resides in the Applications directory. This application allows a user with admin privileges and an Apple ID to browse Apple's online App Store, purchase (including no-cost purchases), and install new applications, bypassing Enterprise software inventory controls. Any admin user can install software in the /Applications directory whether from internet downloads, thumb drives, optical media, cloud storage, or even binaries through email. Even standard users can run executables downloaded to their home folder by default. The source of the software is not nearly as important as a consistent audit of all installed software for patch compliance and appropriateness.

A single user desktop where the user, administrator, and the person approving software are all the same person probably does not need to audit software inventory to this extent. It is helpful in the case of stability problems or malware, however.

Scan systems on a monthly basis and determine the number of unauthorized pieces of software that are installed. Verify that if an unauthorized piece of software is found one month, it is removed from the system the next.

Export System Information through the built-in System Information Application or other third-party tools on an organizationally defined timetable.

Rationale:

Part of comprehensive IT security involves device management and ensuring that all software is authorized and patched. Checking for macOS updates and app updates are relatively simple for the end user, and can even be updated with minimal privileges from trusted sources, if enabled. Remote monitoring of the patch status for software maintained through Apple is very well supported by management applications. Neither Apple capabilities nor third-party patch management solutions will cover all mission-necessary software for most organizations. Full visibility into software present on the system enables vulnerability and risk management.

P.S. Don't forget about browser plugins/extensions for all installed software.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

      info         : "Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices which enumerate devices and services within a local subnet. DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled.

Rationale:

Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of 'I'm here!' messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed.

Impact:

Some applications, like Final Cut Studio and AirPort Base Station management, may not operate properly if the mDNSResponder is turned off."

Run the following command to disable Bonjour Advertising services:

Anything Bonjour discovers is already available on the network and probably discoverable with network scanning tools. The security benefit of disabling Bonjour for that reason is minimal."

An access warning may reduce a casual attacker's tendency to target the system. Access warnings may also aid in the prosecution of an attacker by evincing the attacker's knowledge of the system's private status, acceptable use policy, and authorization requirements.

Users will have to click on the window with the Login text before logging into the computer."

Email is routinely abused by attackers, spammers and marketers. The 'Protect Mail Activity' control reduces risk by hiring the current IP address of your Mac and privately downloading remote content.

The Protect Mail Activity function of privately downloading remote content is not applicable for those users that do not download any remote content.

Rationale:

There are conflicting concerns in the retention of browser history. Unlimited retention:

Consumes disk space

Preferred by on disk forensics teams

User searchable for old visited pages

User privacy concerns

Security concerns to retain old links that may be stale or lead to compromised pages or pages with changes or inappropriate content

Old browser history becomes stale and the use or misuse of the data can lead to unwanted outcomes. Search engine results are maintained and often provide much more relevant current information than old website visit information.

Impact:

If old browsing history is not available it will not be available to authorized or unauthorized users. Some users may find old and even stale information useful.
