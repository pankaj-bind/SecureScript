  description : "2.2 Ensure 'Protect RE' Firewall Filter includes explicit terms for all Management Services"
  info        : "The Firewall Filter used to protect the Junos Device should include explicit terms for all Management, Automation and Monitoring Services used

Rationale:

Junos supports a wide range of Management, Monitoring and Automation Services, making it an extremely flexible and adaptable platform. However, as with any computer system, the more services that are offered and the more hosts to which they are available, the wider attack surface is offered to a potential attacker.

Because Management Services provide users the ability to remotely configure, monitor or otherwise control the Junos Device, it is important to restrict access to just trusted hosts for each individual service.

Examples of Junos Management Services include (but are not limited to):

Telnet (which should not be used, as described elsewhere)

SSH (a secure alternative to Telnet)

JWeb GUI (a web based interface over HTTP or HTTPS)

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol, typically used for monitoring)

NETCONF (an XML-RPC based automation standard)

gRPC (a Remote Procedure Call based automation interface)

REST API (an HTTP/S based automation interface)

DMI (Device Management Interface - used by Network Management Systems, including Junos Space)

Unused services should ideally not be running at all - for example, if you do not use the JWeb GUI to manage your device, the service should be disabled under the [edit system services] configuration hierarchy as described elsewhere in this Benchmark.

Service's which are in use to manage your network should be appropriately secured using recommendations elsewhere in this Benchmark and have access restricted to trusted hosts for that service, using explicit terms in the 'Protect RE' Firewall Filter discussed in Recommendation 2.1 Ensure 'Protect RE' Firewall Filter is set for inbound traffic to the Routing Engine.

A full discussion of Firewall Filter design and evaluation is beyond the scope of this Benchmark, but is covered in more detail in Chapter 4 of the Juniper DayOne book Hardening Junos Devices 2nd Edition, available for free from the Juniper DayOne Tech Libary.

Impact:

Firewall Filters should be carefully tested before implementation on production systems as incorrect configuration may prevent normal services functioning.

It is strongly recommended that changes to Firewall Filters are applied using commit confirmed so that changes will be automatically rolled back should they prevent the administrator from connecting to the Junos Device.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "A full discussion of Firewall Filters is beyond the scope of this Benchmark.
It is important to ensure that Firewall Filters include terms to match and accept all of your required Routing Protocols, Management Services and any other services used on your Junos Device. As noted elsewhere, it is strongly recommended that changes to Firewall Filters applied to the Loopback interface always be applied using commit confirmed so that the change will be automatically rolled back should the administrator lose connection after committing the change.
To create a IPv4 firewall filter enter the following command from the [edit firewall] hierarchy.

[edit firewall]
user@host#edit family inet
[edit firewall family inet]
user@host#edit filter <filter name>
[edit firewall family inet filter <filter name>]
user@host#edit term <term name>
[edit firewall family inet filter <filter name> term <term name>]
user@host#set from <match conditions>
user@host#set then <action>

An IPv6 firewall filter, if required, can be configured under the family inet6 from the same hierarchy.
Once a suitable filter has been configured, it must be applied to the Loopback interface, using the following command from the [edit] hierarchy:

[edit]
user@host#set interface lo0 unit 0 family inet filter input <filter name>

If additional Loopback Interface Units are configured (in other Routing Instances), the filter should also be applied to these.
If IPv6 filters are also required, the same command is used but applying to family inet6.
To configure the CIS-Example-IPv4 shown previously in the Audit Procedure, we opted to first configure a prefix-list each for our management-hosts and snmp-servers using the following commands from the [edit policy-options] heirachy:

[edit policy-options]
mwhite@SRX1# set prefix-list management-hosts 172.16.10.0/24
mwhite@SRX1# set prefix-list management-hosts 192.168.17.0/24
mwhite@SRX1# set prefix-list snmp-servers apply-path 'snmp community <*> clients <*>'

The management-hosts prefix-list is a manual list of IP subnets which can be used in multiple policies or terms. If we add or remote IPs on the list, it will cause all of the terms to be updated, rather than having to manually update our management hosts in multiple locations.
The snmp-servers prefix-list used an apply-path to return all configured SNMP Clients (the Network Management Servers (NMS) which will be permitted to poll this Junos Device using Simple Network Management Protocol) from elsewhere in the configuration. The same technique can be used to create a list of all configured NTP Servers, BGP Peers and so on. Lists created using an apply-path will automatically update when the source does, so if we add a new SNMP Client, the prefix-list updated automatically.
We then created an IPv4 firewall filter from the [edit firewall] hierarchy:

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetSSH from source-prefix-list management-hosts
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetSSH from destination-port ssh
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetSSH then count SSH-Allowed
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetSSH then log
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetSSH then syslog
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetSSH then accept
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS from source-prefix-list management-hosts
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS from destination-port https
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS then count HTTPS-Allowed
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS then log
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS then syslog
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS then accept
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptSNMP from source-prefix-list snmp-servers
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptSNMP from destination-port snmp
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptSNMP then count SNMP-Poll-Allowed
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptSNMP then accept

The first two terms AcceptSSH and AcceptHTTPS accept SSH and HTTPS traffic respectively from any host listed in the the management-hosts prefix-list. Traffic matching these terms is also logged and separate counters incremented each time the term is hit.
Term 3, AcceptSNMP accepts SNMP Polling from SNMP Clients (SNMP Servers) which were automatically added to the snmp-servers prefix-list. As polling could be frequent, no logging is used, but a counter is incremented.
The filter can now be applied to the Loopback interface, using the following command from the [edit interfaces] hierarchy:

[edit interfaces]
mwhite@SRX1# set unit 0 family inet filter input CIS-Example-IPv4

Note - The example filter above not complete and may not be suitable for all environments - all other traffic to the Junos Device will be discarded.
Your filters should include terms for all of the Management, Monitoring and Automation services, as well as any Routing Protocols or other services such as IPSEC or BFD in use in your network.

Default Value:

No firewall filters are configured by default."

  description : "2.3 Ensure 'Protect RE' Firewall filter includes Rate-Limiting for Management Services terms"
  info        : "Policers should be applied to Management Services

Rationale:

Junos supports a wide range of Management, Monitoring and Automation Services, making it an extremely flexible and adaptable platform. However, as with any computer system, the more services that are offered and the more hosts to which they are available, the wider attack surface is offered to a potential attacker.

An attacker, or a misconfigured or failing management server, might flood a service on the Junos device with excessive traffic in a Denial of Service (or DoS) attack; resulting in increased load and potentially even a failure of the service or targeted device.

To prevent this Rate-limiting can be applied to the Firewall Filter Terms already configured for Management Services in Recommendation 2.1 - Ensure 'Protect RE' Firewall Filter includes explicit terms for all Management Services by configuring a policer as appropriate for the service.

In some environments, it may also be appropriate to configure policers for Routing Protocols or other Services, although this is less common practice and can lead to unstable network conditions without careful design and testing.

A full discussion of how Rate-limiting is configured and implemented in Junos, and across different specific chipsets and platforms, is beyond the scope of this Benchmark. The Junos DayOne books Deploying Basic QoS and Hardening Junos Devices, 2nd Edition are available for Free from the Juniper website and provide excellent coverage of QoS/CoS techniques and the application of Rate-limiting to Firewall Filters respectively.

Impact:

Firewall Filters should be carefully tested before implementation on production systems as incorrect configuration may prevent normal services functioning.

It is strongly recommended that changes to Firewall Filters are applied using commit confirmed so that changes will be automatically rolled back should they prevent the administrator from connecting to the Junos Device.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "A full discussion of Firewall Filters is beyond the scope of this Benchmark.
It is important to ensure that Firewall Filters include terms to match and accept all of your required Routing Protocols, Management Services and any other services used on your Junos Device. As noted elsewhere, it is strongly recommended that changes to Firewall Filters applied to the Loopback interface always be applied using commit confirmed so that the change will be automatically rolled back should the administrator lose connection after committing the change.
In this example we will add Rate-Limiting to the Management Services terms configured in Recommendation 2.2 Ensure 'Protect RE' Firewall Filter includes explicit terms for all Management Services Draft using the following commands from the [edit firewall] hierarchy:
First we need to create the two 'policer' definitions, which can be re-used in multiple terms of filters.

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set policer limit-10m if-exceeding bandwidth-limit 10m
mwhite@SRX1# set policer limit-10m if-exceeding burst-size-limit 625k
mwhite@SRX1# set policer limit-10m then discard
mwhite@SRX1# set policer limit-1m if-exceeding bandwidth-limit 1m
mwhite@SRX1# set policer limit-1m if-exceeding burst-size-limit 15k
mwhite@SRX1# set policer limit-1m then discard

These policers set a bandwidth-limit of 10Mb/s and 1Mb/s respectively, with an appropriate burst-size set on each proportional to the configured limit to allow bursts to briefly exceed the limit and smooth the impact of the policer on the service.
The limit-10m policer is then applied to both the AcceptSSH and AcceptHTTPS terms in the CIS-Example-IPv4 configured previously. The policer applies separately for each term, so SSH and HTTPS can receive 10Mb/s of traffic each, not a combined 10Mb/s between them.

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptSSH then policer limit-10m
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptHTTPS then policer limit-10m

Finally, we apply the lower 'limit-1m' 1Mb/s policer to the existing AcceptSNMP term:

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptSNMP then policer limit-1m

If it is not already, the filter can now be applied to the Loopback interface, using the following command from the [edit interfaces] hierarchy:

[edit interfaces]
mwhite@SRX1# set unit 0 family inet filter input CIS-Example-IPv4

Note - The example filter above not complete and may not be suitable for all environments - all other traffic to the Junos Device will be discarded.

  info        : "Routing and Switching Protocol traffic should be filtered

Rationale:

Junos devices support a vast range of Routing Protocols to enable flexible services to be deployed. However, as with any computer system, the more services that are offered and the more hosts to which they are available, the wider attack surface is offered to a potential attacker.

In addition, an attacker may seek to connect to Routing Protocols in an attempt to gain knowledge of the network, re-route traffic to perform Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks or disrupt the network to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Limiting the devices able to connect to these sensitive protocols, on a per protocol basis, greatly enhances the security of the device. These protocols might include (but are not limited to):

OSPF

IS-IS

BGP

RIP

To create a IPv4 firewall filter enter the following command from the [edit firewall] hierarchy.

[edit firewall]
user@host#edit family inet
[edit firewall family inet]
user@host#edit filter <filter name>
[edit firewall family inet filter <filter name>]
user@host#edit term <term name>
[edit firewall family inet filter <filter name> term <term name>]
user@host#set from <match conditions>
user@host#set then <action>

An IPv6 firewall filter, if required, can be configured under the family inet6 from the same hierarchy.
Once a suitable filter has been configured, it must be applied to the Loopback interface, using the following command from the [edit] hierarchy:

[edit]
user@host#set interface lo0 unit 0 family inet filter input <filter name>

If additional Loopback Interface Units are configured (in other Routing Instances), the filter should also be applied to these.
If IPv6 filters are also required, the same command is used but applying to family inet6.
In the example below, we add a new term AcceptBGP to the CIS-Example-IPv4 shown previously in the Audit Procedure. We opted to first configure a prefix-list each for our bgp-neighbors using the following command from the [edit policy-options] hierarchy:

[edit policy-options]
mwhite@SRX1# set prefix-list bgp-neighbors apply-path 'protocols bgp group <*> neighbor <*>'

The bgp-neighbors prefix-list used an apply-path to return all configured BGP Neighbors configured for any group under the [edit protocols bgp] configuration. The same technique can be used to create a list of all configured NTP Servers, SNMP Servers and so on. Lists created using an apply-path will automatically update when the source configuration does, so if we add a new BGP Neighbor, the prefix-list is updated automatically.
NOTE - If you are running protocols in multiple Routing Instances, Logical Systems or similar features, you may need to adjust your prefix-list and apply-path to reflect these additional locations.
We can then add a new term to the existing CIS-Example-IPv4 firewall filter with the following commands from the [edit firewall] hierarchy:

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetBGPfrom source-prefix-list bgp-neighbors
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetBGP from protocol tcp
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetBGP from destination-port bgp
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AccpetBGP then count BGP-Allowed
mwhite@SRX1# set family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term AcceptBGP then accept

This filter matches traffic coming from any configured BGP Neighbor to TCP Port 179 and accepts it, incrementing a named counter BGP-Allowed, which helps us with troubleshooting and monitoring.
If it is not already, the filter can now be applied to the Loopback interface, using the following command from the [edit interfaces] hierarchy:

[edit interfaces]
mwhite@SRX1# set unit 0 family inet filter input CIS-Example-IPv4

Note - The example filter above not complete and may not be suitable for all environments - all other traffic to the Junos Device will be discarded.

  info        : "Flood Attack protection should be included in the 'Protect RE' Filter

Rationale:

As with any computer system connected to a network, an attacker may attempt to overwhelm the resources of a Junos device by flooding it with unwanted traffic, consuming resources and potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (or DoS) Attack.

Filtering traffic sources and the available services using a 'Protect RE' filter as discussed elsewhere in this section helps to limit the scope for an attack, but flood attacks using TCP SYN packets, ICMP or other protocols may still be possible.

To prevent this Rate-limiting can be applied to the Firewall Filter by configuring a policer to new terms matching the potential attack traffic.

A full discussion of how Rate-limiting is configured and implemented in Junos, and across different specific chipsets and platforms, is beyond the scope of this Benchmark. The Junos DayOne books Deploying Basic QoS and Hardening Junos Devices, 2nd Edition are available for Free from the Juniper website and provide excellent coverage of QoS/CoS techniques and the application of Rate-limiting to Firewall Filters respectively.

Impact:

Firewall Filters should be carefully tested before implementation on production systems as incorrect configuration may prevent normal services functioning.

It is strongly recommended that changes to Firewall Filters are applied using commit confirmed so that changes will be automatically rolled back should they prevent the administrator from connecting to the Junos Device.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "A full discussion of Firewall Filters is beyond the scope of this Benchmark.
It is important to ensure that Firewall Filters include terms to match and accept all of your required Routing Protocols, Management Services and any other services used on your Junos Device. As noted elsewhere, it is strongly recommended that changes to Firewall Filters applied to the Loopback interface always be applied using commit confirmed so that the change will be automatically rolled back should the administrator lose connection after committing the change.
In this example, we will add the new Flood Protection terms seen in the audit procedure to our existing Firewall Filter from Recommendation 2.3 Ensure 'Protect RE' Firewall filter includes Rate-Limiting for Management Services terms using the following commands from the [edit firewall] hierachy:
First we need to create an additional 'policer' definition, which can be re-used in multiple terms of filters.

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set if-exceeding bandwidth-limit 100k
mwhite@SRX1# set if-exceeding burst-size-limit 15k
mwhite@SRX1# set then discard

This new policer enforces a bandwidth-limit of 100kb/s, with a burst-size proportional to the configured limit to allow bursts to briefly exceed the limit and smooth the impact of the policer on the service.
The new limit-100k policer is used in the new Limit-SYNFlood term, while the other new terms re-use the limit-1m and limit-10m configured previously. A policer applies separately for each term, so SSH, HTTPS and new terms re-using these policers can receive 10Mb/s of traffic each, not a combined 10Mb/s between them.

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# set term Limit-SYNFlood from source-prefix-list management-hosts
mwhite@SRX1# set term Limit-SYNFlood from protocol tcp
mwhite@SRX1# set term Limit-SYNFlood from tcp-flags '(syn & !ack) | fin | rst'
mwhite@SRX1# set term Limit-SYNFlood then policer limit-100k
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptICMP from icmp-type echo-request
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptICMP from icmp-type echo-reply
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptICMP from icmp-type unreachable
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptICMP from icmp-type time-exceeded
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptICMP then policer limit-1m
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptICMP then accept
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTCP-Established from source-port ssh
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTCP-Established from tcp-established
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTCP-Established then policer limit-10m
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTCP-Established then accept
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTraceroute from protocol udp
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTraceroute from destination-port 33434-33523
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTraceroute then policer limit-1m
mwhite@SRX1# set term AcceptTraceroute then accept

Because the Limit-SYNFlood term needs to be executed before any TCP Services like SSH, HTTPS or BGP, we will move the term ahead of the AcceptSSH term configured previously:

[edit firewall]
mwhite@SRX1# insert family inet filter CIS-Example-IPv4 term Limit-SYNFlood before term AcceptSSH

If it is not already, the filter can now be applied to the Loopback interface, using the following command from the [edit interfaces] hierarchy:

[edit interfaces]
mwhite@SRX1# set unit 0 family inet filter input CIS-Example-IPv4

Note - The example filter above not complete and may not be suitable for all environments - all other traffic to the Junos Device will be discarded.

Rationale:

Firewall filters are built up of one or more terms, which are evaluated in order until either one is matched (at which point the terms then action is taken) or the final term has been evaluated, at which point the default action is to discard the packet.

It is important to log packets which are denied by the firewall filter, these may indicate an attempted attack or could suggest a problem in the network or with the firewall filter itself.

A term should be added to the end of the each firewall filter which logs the packet header information and blocks the packet. The discard method is used to block the packet silently, with no message sent back to the source, denying the attacker information and limiting resource usage on the router.

Impact:

Firewall Filters should be carefully tested before implementation on production systems as incorrect configuration may prevent normal services functioning.

Rationale:

An attacker may attempt to bypass security controls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by using the source address of a trusted (generally internal) host, a technique known as spoofing. Packets arriving on external networks should never have a source address from your internal network ranges, especially where the internal networks use RFC1918 private address space or invalid addresses.

Any traffic with an internal source arriving on an external interface is certain to be an attack and should be blocked.

A Firewall Filter should be applied to all external network interfaces and include a term to deny internal address ranges.

The discard method is used to block the packet silently, with no message sent back to the source. This traffic should also be logged to the local routing engine and SYSLOG, allowing attacks to be detected and record kept.

  info        : "Do not use Proxy ARP.

Rationale:

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) provides resolution between IP and MAC Addresses (or other Network and Link Layer addresses on none IP networks) within a Layer 2 network.

Proxy ARP is a service where a device connected to one network (in this case the JUNOS router) answers ARP Requests which are addressed to a host on another network, replying with its own MAC Address and forwarding the traffic on to the intended host.

Sometimes used for extending broadcast domains across WAN links, in most cases Proxy ARP on enterprise networks is used to enable communication for hosts with mis-configured subnet masks, a situation which should no longer be a common problem.

Proxy ARP effectively breaks the LAN Security Perimeter, extending a network across multiple Layer 2 segments. Using Proxy ARP can also allow other security controls such as PVLAN to be bypassed."

Rationale:

JUNOS routers can provide a wide range of services to the network and, as with any computer system, the more services that are offered and the more hosts they are available to, the wider attack surface is offered to a potential attacker.

To protect the router from attack a Firewall Filter should be applied to all inbound traffic to the Routing Engine which limits the hosts able to connect to the router and the services on which they are permitted to connect.

If applied to the lo0 interface the filter will apply to all traffic sent to the Routing Engine rather than to traffic traversing the router. Where IPv6 traffic is also handled by the router a firewall filter will also need to be applied for family inet 6.

See the Firewall section for details of how to configure Firewall Filters.

An attacker posing as one of the target routers BGP neighbors may inject incorrect information into the route table resulting in DoS attack or loss of confidential data through a Man in the Middle attack.

      description : "4.1.4 Ensure Bogon Filtering is set (where EBGP is used)"
      info        : "Bogon prefixes should be filtered when using eBGP.

Rationale:

Bogon Networks are those IP Address blocks which should never appear on the Internet. Examples include loopback addresses, RFC1918 private addresses and IP blocks which have not yet been assigned by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) to one of the RIRs (Regional Internet Registries). If traffic arrives at your network edge from a Bogon network, the traffic is almost certainly malicious and should be filtered. Studies have shown instances where as much as 60% of DoS attack traffic is being sourced from Bogon or Martian (a subset which includes RFC1918 and RFC3330 networks) addresses.

As a rule Bogon traffic should also be filtered from leaving the network as it may be malicious or represent a possible information leak. Either way, return traffic would not get back. Bogon information can be obtained from a number of sources such as:

IANA - Obtain the current IPv4 assignments list, anything that is shown as Unallocated or Reserved is a Bogon.

Team Cymru provides, what is effectively, the definitive Bogon list in a range of formats and through a BGP Route Server project.

RIPE NCC also provides lists of Unallocated, Martian and combined Bogon space.

An important point to remember about Bogon filtering is that the addresses that make up Bogon space change. Unallocated addresses get allocated, reserved networks may be re-purposed, etc. If you keep your Bogon filters static, you may accidently block valid traffic from these addresses. Ensure you have a procedure to keep your Bogon lists up to date!

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "JUNOS offers a variety of options for filtering Bogons and Martians, which is why this item is not scored. Some of the more common options are discussed below.
1 - The Martian Table Most Martian space (but not all, else you would not be able to use your router on private networks) is blocked using the Martian Routing Table, which is discussed elsewhere in this Benchmark and configured under the [edit routing-options martians] hierarchy. Route updates for prefixes in this special table are ignored, so adding Bogons here will prevent them being learned through any routing protocol.
2 - Ingress Prefix Filtering Ingress Filtering should be used on eBGP sessions to prevent your own prefixes being advertised back to your network or, in the case of ISP networks, customer networks advertising prefixes other than those allocated to them.
The other filtering types are covered previously. Prefix lists are configured under the [edit policy-options] hierarchy, but are discussed here as they are applied under the [edit protocols bgp <group name>] hierarchy. First configure a policy:

[edit policy-options]
user@host#edit policy-statement <policy name> term <term name>
[edit policy-options policy-statement <policy name> <term name>]
user@host#set from route-filter <network>/<mask> <exact | orlonger | prefix-length-range <start>-<end>> reject

The last stage should be repeated for each prefix required, but as several options are shown, a couple of examples are given below:

[edit policy-options <policy name> <term name>]
user@host#set from route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 exact reject
user@host#set from route-filter 10.0.0.0/8 orlonger reject
user@host#set from route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 prefix-length-range /29-/32 reject

The first line in the example rejects a default route advertised to the router and only that route. The second line will filter any route from the 10.0.0.0/8 range, for instance 10.1.1.0/24 or 10.2.0.0/16. The final line is a little more complex, this will reject any route with a mask length of /29, /30, /31 or /32 (generally eBGP routes should be summarized into larger prefixes than this). Having defined a policy, we need to apply it.
As with most other BGP configuration options, you can apply the policy at Global, Group or Neighbor levels as suites your needs. In this example we will apply the policy to a group containing all our eBGP peers:

[edit protocols bgp group <group name>]
user@host#set import <policy name/s>

3 - Peering with a Bogon Route Server As far as I am aware, the idea of using a BGP Peering session to a Route Server for updates on Bogon networks was hatched by Team Cymru and they offer a free, public Bogon Route Server, which you can peer with to keep you Bogon list up to date. The theory works equally well by peering to a route server of your own, allowing a greater degree of control over your Bogon list updates for your organization if desired. First a static route is created and configured to discard traffic. An address that is reserved for Test or Example networks is used, you may need to allow this /32 prefix in the Martian Table:

[edit routing-options]
user@host#set static route 192.0.2.1/32 discard no-readvertise retain

An import policy should be set to match prefixes from the route servers AS and the Community (if used) for Bogon updates, setting the next hop to 192.0.2.1 and accepting the route.

[edit policy-options]
user@host#edit policy-statement <policy name> term <term name>
[edit policy-options policy-statement <policy name> term <term name>]
user@host#set from protocol bgp as-path <peer AS> community <community>
user@host#set then next-hop 192.0.2.1

Finally the BGP Peering and Group is configured with the import policy above and not to export. In addition security options covered in other recommendations should be used:

[edit protocols bgp <group name>]
user@host#set type external description 'bogon route servers'
user@host#set import <policy name>
user@host#set peer-as <AS of Route Server>
user@host#set neighbor <neighbors IP>
user@host#set local-address <local IP to use for peering>

Default Value:

Most Martians are filtered by default, most Bogons are not."

  description : "4.1.6 Ensure RPKI is set for Origin Validation of EBGP peers"
  info        : "Use RPKI for Origin Validation on Public BGP Peering

Rationale:

In addition to filtering Bogon and Maritan routes JUNOS routers peering with eBGP neighbors should also apply Ingress Filtering to prevent the router processing bad updates sent from the neighbor router, either maliciously or by accident.

Traditional Ingress Filtering, outlined in Recommendation 4.1.5 Ensure Ingress Filtering is set for EBGP peers, uses manually administrated Routing Policy configured on individual routers to validate prefixes being received from BGP Neighbours in Peer Autonomous Systems (ASs) based on Internet Routing Registry (IRR) entries.

This technique is maintenance intensive and prone to errors, although semi automated tools do exist to help. It is also not readily enforceable on Transit Connections, where the router does not connect directly to the Origin AS, but instead receives their routes via a Transit Service Provider. The receiving AS has no option but to trust that their upstream provider/s are correctly implementing filtering, with no way to validate the routing information they receive independently.

This leaves BGP Routing prone to Hijack Attacks, with numerous incidents in recent years causing issues both with reachability for some prefixes/ASs and with theft of information, after traffic is re-routed to fake destinations.

To combat this the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) framework was created to allow Public ASs to sign their Resources (IPv4 and IPv6 Prefixes they will originate) by creating a Route Origination Authorizations (ROA) Certificate, through their Regional Internet Registry (RIR) (AFRINIC, ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC or RIPE NCC).

Public ASs can perform Origin Validation on the routes received through BGP, whether from direct Peer networks or through a Transit Provider. The Junos Router does this by checking the route information it receives through BGP with a RPKI Validator Server (sometimes called an RPKI Cache Server) through the RPKI-RTR Protocol defined in RFC 8210. The RPKI Validator maintains a cache of ROAs distributed by the RIRs and returns a verdict to the Router, which may be either:

Valid - The AS, Prefix and Prefix Length all match a valid ROA

Invalid - A matching ROA exists for the Prefix, but either the Origin AS or the Prefix Length does not match

Unknown or Not Found - No matching ROA exists, most likely the Resource Owner has not created an RPKI with their RIR

Routing Policy on the Junos device is configured to determine whether routes should be accepted based on results returned by the RPKI Validator. Most commonly Valid and Unknown/Not Found routes will be accepted and Invalid rejected, but this should be determined by the policy of each individual AS.

A full discussion of RPKI is beyond the scope of this Benchmark, but is covered in detail in the Juniper TechLibary BGP Origin Validation Using Resource Public Key Infrastructure, available for free from the Juniper website.

RIPE NCC, one of the RIRs, provide detailed instructions for installing several common RPKI Validators (including their own) in How to Install an RPKI Validator.

Impact:

Incorrect configuration of any Route Filtering may impact on reachability

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Configuration and deployment of an RPKI Validator and a full discussion of all configuration options is beyond the scope of this Benchmark.
To configure an RPKI Validator Server, issue following commands from the [edit routing-options] configuration hierarchy:

[edit routing-options]
user@host# set validation group <group-name> session <RPKI Server IP> port <RPKI Server Port> local-address <Local IP>

Where:

<group-name> is a descriptive name chosen for the RPKI Server

<RPKI Server IP> is the IP address used on the RPKI Validator for the RPKI-RTR protocol

<RPKI Server Port> is the port configured on RPKI Validator for the RPKI-RTR protocol

<Local IP> is a Local Interface address that the Router should use as the source for RPKI-RTR sessions

**Note ** - If multiple Logical Systems are configured, RPKI Validation will need to be configured separately for all LSYS being used for Public BGP Peering.
Next create a Routing Policy to accept or reject routes based on the RPKI Validation Database, using the following commands for each term from the [edit policy-options] heirachy:

[edit policy-options]
user@host# set policy-statement <policy-name> term <term-name> from protocol bgp
user@host# set policy-statement <policy-name> term <term-name> from validation-database <RPKI Database Result>
user@host# set policy-statement <policy-name> term <term-name> then validation-state <RPKI State>
user@host# set policy-statement <policy-name> term <term-name> then <action>

Where:

<policy-name> is a descriptive name for the Routing Policy

<term-name> is a descriptive name for the Term

<RPKI Database Result> is the result returned by the RPKI Validator

<RPKI State> is the RPKI State to be recorded locally for the route (normally the same as the RPKI Validator result)

<action> is a Routing Policy action such as to accept or reject the route

These steps can be repeated until all of your required terms and actions are configured.
Here we create the rpki-validation Routing Policy given in the Audit Procedure example:

[edit policy-options]
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term valid from protocol bgp
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term valid from validation-database valid
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term valid then validation-state valid
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term valid then accept
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term invalid from protocol bgp
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term invalid from validation-database invalid
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term invalid then validation-state invalid
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term invalid then reject
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term unknown from protocol bgp
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term unknown then validation-state unknown
user@host# set policy-statement rpki-validation term unknown then accept

The final term matches on all BGP Routes which do not return either valid or invalid from the RPKI Server, so does not require the additional match condition on the validation-database result.
The RPKI Routing Policy should now be applied to all BGP Neighbours or Groups used for Public BGP peering using the following commands from the [edit protocols bgp] configuration heirachy:

[edit protocols bgp]
user@host# set group <group-name> import <policy-name>

OR

[edit protocols bgp]
user@host# set neighbor <Neighbor IP> import <policy-name>

Rationale:

Where it is deployed, IS-IS routing is vital for normal operation of an organization's network infrastructure. Correct route information is required for routers to correctly direct traffic through the network. An attacker posing as one of the target routers IS-IS neighbors may inject incorrect information into the route table resulting in DoS attack or loss of confidential data through a Man in the Middle attack.

On Juniper routers (as well as routers from some other manufacturers such as Cisco or Brocade) it is possible to authenticate neighbors using an SHA1 digest of elements in PDU combined with a sequence number to protect against Replay attacks.

SHA1 provides a stronger algorithm than the older MD5 standard, but is not so widely supported on none Juniper platforms so should only be deployed once you are certain that all of the devices with which IS-IS Adjacencies will be formed support SHA1-HMAC authentication.

SHA1 authentication is configured differently than either Simple (which sends the password cleartext and should never be used) or MD5 authentication methods. Instead of configuring the key directly at the IS-IS protocol, area or interface level, support for SHA1 authentication is added via the Hitless Key Rollover extensions. This provides the added benefit of introducing mechanisms to coordinate regular changes to authentication keys and make changes to authentication settings without the need to reset IS-IS adjacencies."
      solution    : "If you have deployed IS-IS in your network you should consider configuring Hitless Key Rollover with SHA1 authentication for all neighbors at each IS-IS Level configured.
First a key-chain must be configured. The same key-chain may be used for multiple levels or separate key-chains used for each level (or even for individual interfaces where required). From the [edit security authentication-key-chains] hierarchy issue the following commands:

[edit security authentication-key-chains]
user@host#set key-chain <name> key <key number> secret '<secret key>'
user@host#set key-chain <name> key <key number> start-time '<yyyy-mm-dd.hh:mm:ss>'
user@host#set key-chain <name> key <key number> algorithm hmac-sha-1
user@host#set key-chain <name> key <key number> options isis-enhanced

The start-time must be provided for all keys and provides the mechanism for controlled key rollover. Keys with a start time in the future can be configured across all of the devices in advance, when the time is reached all of the devices will hitlessly rollover to the new keys without disruption to IS-IS Adjacencies.
Next the key should be set for all Levels at which SHA1 HMAC authentication will be used. From the [edit protocols isis] hierarchy, issue the following command:

[edit protocols isis]
user@host#set level <level> authentication-key-chain <name>

Where a different key is required for a specific area or interface, the key-chain used at the Level can be overridden on a per interface per level basis using the following command from the '[edit protocols isis]' hierarchy:

[edit protocols isis]
user@host#set interface <interface name> level <level> hello-authentication-key-chain <name>

Note - Only the setting of the authentication-key-chain on a per level basis is included in the audit procedure for scoring this recommendation, the per interface override is included as additional information only.

Rationale:

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a Forwarding Plane feature which allows more rapid detection of a failed neighbor then can be achieved through a routing protocols' normal detection mechanisms, providing faster reconvergence.

If no authentication was used an attacker may replay or spoof BFD messages to destabilize a network and/or prevent proper reconvergence resulting in a Denial of Service. Several authentication mechanisms are supported for BFD ranging from plain text password, which should not be used, to meticulously keyed SHA1.

The latter provides the strongest hashing algorithm and best replay protection, with the sequence number being updated on each packet, and it is this mechanism that should be used in most cases.

However, if None Stop Routing (NSR) features are required; meticulously keyed SHA1 or MD5 should not be used as the BFD Sessions using these algorithms may fail when switching to the Backup Routing Engine.

Both BFD peers must be configured with the same keys and method, otherwise the BFD link may be declared down resulting in a reconvergence. Because it is not possible to configure both ends of an existing BFD link simultaneously you may need to use Loose Authentication Checking as a transitional step by configuring the loose-check option.

Impact:

BFD Authentication must be configured to use the same Key and Algorithm on all neighbors/peers with which the session will be used. A mismatch will result in the BFD session failing and related routes being declared unreachable.

BFD Authentication with meticulous-keyed-sha-1 and meticulous-keyed-md5 algorithms should not be used in conjunction with NSR and GRES. Fail over between Routing Engines will cause Authentication to fail.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "If you have deployed BFD, authentication can be configured by issuing the following commands.
First set the authentication algorithm and keychain from the appropriate [.* bfd-liveness-detection] hierarchy, in this example we are configuring BFD Authentication for OSPF Neighbors on Interface Ge-0/0/0.0:

[edit protocols ospf interface ge-0/0/0.0 bfd-liveness-detection]
user@host#set authentication algorithm <algorithm>
user@host#set authentication key-chain <key-chain>

Where:

<algorithm> is either keyed-md5, keyed-sha-1, meticulous-keyed-md5 or meticulous-keyed-sha-1, which is preferred but is not compatible with NSR and other failover options.

<key-chain> is the name of a configured key-chain (see below).

If a Key Chain is not already defined, you should create one by issuing the following command at the [edit security authentication-key-chains] hierarchy:

[edit security authentication-key-chains]
user@host#set key-chain <key-chain> key <key number> secret <key>

Where:

<key-chain> is the name of the key-chain already configured for the BFD session

<key number> is the number to identify this key, used for key rollover

<key> is the Shared Secret Key

The <algorithm> and <key> must be the same on all devices which will use the BFD session being configured.
If the BFD Session is already in use, setting Authentication on one side before the other will cause the BFD Session (and the associated routes or adjacencies) to be declared down resulting in loss of traffic. To aide in rollout of BFD Authentication, JUNOS Devices can operate in a 'Loos Authentication Check' mode, whereby they will send Authentication information, but will not reject unauthenticated messages.
This should be used in transition only and can be configured with the following command from the same [.* bfd-liveness-detection] hierarchy:

BFD may be configured at a wide variety of configuration hierarchies, for different Protocols, Routing Instances or even for Static Routes.

Where it is deployed, LDP is vital for normal operation of an MPLS network. LDP is used to determine Label mapping and populate the routers Forwarding Information Base (FIB). An attacker posing as one of the target routers LDP peers may attempt to inject incorrect label information or exploit a vulnerability in the routers LDP implementation to cause an information disclosure or denial of service.

On Juniper routers (as well as routers from some other vendors) it is possible to authenticate LDP sessions using a Cipher-based Message Authentication Code method with the AES encryption algorithm.

AES-128-CMAC-96 is significantly more robust than the MD5-HMAC method, which has traditionally been used for LDP session authentication, and should be used wherever both LSRs support it (such as in an all Juniper deployment).

Where support for AES-128-CMAC-96 is not available; SHA1-HMAC, while not as strong as the AES method, should be strongly preferred over MD5-HMAC which is considerably weaker.

Rationale:

Where it is deployed, LDP is vital for normal operation of an MPLS network. LDP is used to determine Label mapping and populate the routers Forwarding Information Base (FIB). An attacker posing as one of the target routers LDP peers may attempt to inject incorrect label information or exploit a vulnerability in the routers LDP implementation to cause an information disclosure or denial of service.

On Juniper routers (as well as routers from some other vendors) it is possible to authenticate LDP sessions using a Cipher-based Message Authentication Code method with the AES encryption algorithm.

AES-128-CMAC-96 is significantly more robust than the MD5-HMAC method, which has traditionally been used for LDP session authentication, and should be used wherever both LSRs support it (such as in an all Juniper deployment).

Where support for AES-128-CMAC-96 is not available; SHA1-HMAC, while not as strong as the AES method, should be strongly preferred over MD5-HMAC which is considerably weaker.

Strong LDP Session Authentication is configured on a per session-group basis, allowing you to easily support different algorithms with different groups if necessary.

  description : "4.12.1 Ensure LLDP is Disabled if not Required"
  info        : "LLDP should be disabled when not required

Rationale:

The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a vendor-neutral and widely supported standard used for network devices to advertise information about their capabilities, identity, software and management details to other network devices on the LAN. LLDP is specified in the IEEE 802.1AB-2005 standard.

It is broadly similar in purpose and application to the older, proprietary Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) which is still widely used in Cisco networks, but less widely in multivendor environments (and is not supported on Junos).

Devices configured for LLDP advertise information on all chosen Ethernet interfaces by sending an Ethernet Frame containing an LLDPDU to a Multicast Address (several address options existing, including Unicast) which 802.1D compliant switches should not forward further. This information is specified in a sequence of Type-Length-Value (TLV) data structures, which may include:

System hostname and description (system-name and system-description TLVs)

Port details and description for the sending interface (mac-phy-config-status, port-description)

VLAN name and description for the sending interface (vlan-name, port-vid)

Management IP address for the Junos device (management-address)

Device capabilities (such as Switch or Router) (system-capabilities, preformatted based on model)

LAGP Link Aggregation information (link-aggregation)

Device Serial Number (jnpr-chassis-serial)

Further information and additional TLVs

This information can be extremely useful when documenting or troubleshooting a network, but is also extremely useful to a potential attacker, either directly connected to the device or having compromised a neighbouring device.

To reduce the information given to a potential attacker, in high security environments LLDP should be disabled where it is not absolutely required for normal operation. LLDP can either be disabled globally, or on a per interface basis (for example, leaving LLDP enabled on access ports where it may be used for PoE or VoIP applications, but disabling it on infrastructure links or connections to untrusted networks).

Impact:

LLDP is commonly used to support VoIP and devices such as Wireless APs or Access Control systems which make use of PoE for power - disabling LLDP or LLDP-MED for these interfaces may result in service disruption.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Rationale:

The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a vendor-neutral and widely supported standard used for network devices to advertise information about their capabilities, identity, software and management details to other network devices on the LAN. LLDP is specified in the IEEE 802.1AB-2005 standard.

Link Layer Discovery Protocol - Media Endpoint Discovery (LLDP-MED) is an extension of LLDP published by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) in the ANSI/TIA-1057 standard. LLDP-MED is primarily used to enable Voice over IP (VoIP) services by adding additional Type-Length-Value (TLV) data structures to the existing LLDPDU Ethernet Frames sent by LLDP. This information may include:

Detailed information about Power Supply Type, Source and Priority (in the ext-power-via-mdi TLV)

The physical location of the endpoint (configured via Emergency Location Identification Number (ELIN) or Geographic Location, in the location-id TLV)

The Network Policy (VLAN configuration, DiffServ code points, in the network-policy TLV).

This information may be vital to provision of VoIP or other Media services, or when documenting/troubleshooting the network; but is also extremely useful to a potential attacker, either directly connected to the device or having compromised a neighbouring device.

To reduce the information given to a potential attacker, in high security environments LLDP-MED should be disabled where it is not absolutely required for normal operation.

  description     : "6.7.2 Ensure Multiple External NTP Servers are set"
  info            : "At least 3 External NTP Servers should be set

Rationale:

Keeping time settings consistent across a network is vital if log data is to be meaningful and usable in understanding faults and security incidents. Consistent time settings are also fundamental to the operation of some network protocols and services such as IPSec, PKI and 802.1x which may be critical to many networks.

In sensitive environments, to ensure that the time on your JUNOS devices is consistent with other devices in your network, at least three NTP Servers external to the device should be configured.

Although NTP provides for a Peer to Peer type implementation, where individual time servers are not specified and methods such as broadcast and multicast are utilized to synchronize time between hosts, in almost all real world cases a Server / Client model should be used for network devices - even if multicast or broadcast methods are used for other types of hosts. Using specified time sources allows you to better secure, monitor and manage your NTP implementation; simplifying debugging and allowing tighter control of NTP traffic.

IETF BCP 13 (Best Common Practice), suggests that 'Operators who are concerned with maintaining accurate time SHOULD use at least 4 independent, diverse sources of time. Four sources will provide sufficient backup in case one source goes down. If four sources are not available, operators MAY use fewer sources, subject to the risks outlined above.'

Options for NTP time sources may include Public NTP Servers, such as those provided by pool.ntp.org, Shared NTP Servers, such as those provided by many Internet Exchanges for use by members, or Private NTP Servers operated by your organisation for your own exclusive use and synchronised using MSF Radio, GPS or internal Crystal/Atomic Clocks.

It is Strongly Recommended that administrators of devices requiring Level 2 compliance consider the use of Private NTP Servers for some or all of the time sources within the NTP Architecture.

Using multiple NTP Servers, not only provides for a more reliable service, but also protects against 'Falsetickers' (compromised or untrustworthy time sources providing incorrect time). This is based on the rule of needing 2n+1 True clocks, where n is the number of true clocks.

So protection against 1 falseticker requires 4 upstream servers, against 2 falsetickers 5 upstream and 7 are needed to protect against 3 compromised sources. See SelectingOffsiteNTPServers at NTP.org for a more detailed discussion.

Impact:

If time is not synchronised between devices, log messages cannot readily be correlated to allow administrators to understand events on the network. In addition, many services such as IPSEC, PKI or 802.1x which rely on Encryption may not function correctly if time and date settings are not properly maintained."

Rationale:

When the router boots or when a new Routing Engine is installed its time may have drifted or be set beyond the maximum amount where periodic updates can return it to the correct time, resulting in the correct time never being set.

To prevent this situation; a Boot Server should be set from which the JUNOS device will obtain its time as it loads.

Because the ntpdate utility, which contacts the Boot Server, runs prior to many of the other core demons, such as rpd, the Boot Server should be reachable from the device's management interface (fxp0 on most routers, 'em0' or 'me0' on some other platforms) without any Routing Protocol learned routes or Tunnels being available.

For this reason, the Boot Server may often be a different NTP server to that used during normal operation, potentially just being the management interface of another router in the same management subnet.

A Boot Server should be specified wherever possible, however, reachability of an NTP Server or another network device through Out of Band Management is not possible in all deployment scenarios; therefore this Recommendation is given at Level 2 as additional equipment or cost may be required for implementation.

All JUNOS platforms support HMAC with NTP Versions 3 and 4 using MD5 and some platforms also support the more robust SHA1 and SHA2-256 algorithms.

Message Digest 5 (MD5) is an older hashing mechanism dating back to the early 90's. Since 2004 an increasing number of collision vulnerabilities have been shown in MD5 and the algorithm is no longer considered suitable for authentication and integrity protection of sensitive material or X.509 certificates.

While not supported across all devices, most JUNOS devices now support use of SHA1 and SHA2-256 HMAC for NTP message authentication. This feature is documented through Juniper Feature Explorer as Enhancement to NTP authentication method and is supported on most Junos devices from Junos OS 18.2R1 onward (though individual platform support varies).

Like MD5, SHA1 is now considered deprecated due to the risk of collisions. As a result, in high security environments it is recommended that SHA2-256 be used for authentication of all NTP Servers or Peers (where this Junos device itself is acting as an NTP Server).

  info        : "Configuration files should be encrypted.

Rationale:

On many JUNOS platforms the configuration files are stored on a removal flash file system.

A malicious user with even momentary physical access to the router could readily remove the flash card, gaining access to the device's configuration which is likely to contain extremely sensitive details.

Exposure to this type of attack increased in Branch Office or Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) installations or where devices are transported by third parties post configuration.

To prevent an attacker accessing the configuration files from flash, JUNOS Devices offer a facility to encrypt the /config and /var/db/config directories using AES or DES algorithms.

Note - Export restrictions mean that AES is not available in all regions.

Impact:

The configuration files will be encrypted on storage and the JUNOS Device will use the key stored in it's EEPROM to decrypt the configuration file at boot.

Adding the unique option will cause the JUNOS Device to combine the device Serial Number with the entered key when creating the Encryption Key, meaning that the configuration can only be loaded by this JUNOS Device - even with the key being configured."
  solution    : "To enable Configuration File Encryption, you must first set an encryption key by issuing the following command from Operational Mode:

user@host>request system set-encryption-key

You will be prompted to enter and then verify the key.
The preferred encryption algorithm may be specified by adding the algorithm option, or left as default. If the device is running the US/Domestic version of JUNOS the default algorithm will be AES. Devices running the Export version of JUNOS will default to the weaker DES standard and cannot be configured to support AES.
Optionally, the unique option may be specified. This will cause JUNOS to combine the device's Serial Number as part of the Encryption Key, making the configuration unloadable on any other JUNOS device, even with the key set at the prompt.
Once a key has been set the following command should be issued from the [edit system] hierarchy:

[edit system]
user@host# set encrypt-configuration-files

To prevent confusion Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) should be used for all routers to allow consistent logging timestamps.

Rationale:

JUNOS routers ship with 4 Predefined Login Classes for user Authorization, these are:

super-user

read-only

operator

unauthorized

These classes provide basic Authorization, restricting what users in each class can or cannot do, to allow organizations to get a router up and running, but do not provide fine grained control needed by all but very smallest organizations.

The built in classes also do not meet the other recommendations in this section. For example, the super-user class (which is the only built in class with read/write permissions) also has permission to start a Unix Shell and does not have an Idle Session Timeout.

Because of these limitations it is recommended that Custom Login Classes be defined following the principle of least privilege, where each class of users is granted only those permissions needed to complete their job role.

However, defining and maintaining Custom Login Classes locally on each router, switch, firewall or other network device can quickly become difficult and error prone in a larger environment.

For larger networks JUNOS provides for extremely fine grained access control rules to be defined on an External AAA server running either RADIUS or TACACS+ through the use of Vendor Specific Attributes which map to the same permissions that can be set locally for a class.

Vendor Specific Attributes (or VSAs) are standards based extensions to the RADIUS and TACACS+ protocols and are supported on most implementations by defining an appropriate dictionary.

When performing Authorization using External RADIUS or TACACS+ services, it is recommended that a single 'remote' user is configured on the device and mapped to a 'remote' class with minimal permissions set. The user should be named 'remote' where possible, as this name is reserved by JUNOS as the account to which users are mapped when authenticated through External AAA and for whom the Juniper-Local-User-Name VSA is not set.

When a user is authenticated by RADIUS or TACACS+ the server can return a number of VSAs including:

Juniper-Local-User-Name - Maps the user to a local user 'template account', if this is not specified the single 'remote' user account is used.

Juniper-User-Permissions - Allows the server to set the same permissions as would be set in a login class locally. These permission are added to those of the remote user's configured class.

Juniper-Allow-Commands - Uses an Extended Regular Expression to grant Operational Mode commands in addition to those allowed by the user's class.

Juniper-Deny-Commands - Uses an Extended Regular Expression to deny Operational Mode commands which would otherwise be allowed by the user's class.

Juniper-Allow-Configuration - As with the Allow Commands, but to grant Configuration Mode commands not normally allowed by the user's class.

Juniper-Deny-Configuration - As with Deny Commands, but to deny Configuration Mode commands which would otherwise be allowed by the user's class.

NOTE - This is not a complete list of all attributes and uses the RADIUS VSA naming convention. Equivalent TACACS+ VSAs match the above but with slightly different naming.

By combining the use of the above VSAs from either a RADIUS or TACACS+ server, it is possible to define granular access control equivalent to that which can be set using locally configured Login Classes, but without the need to configure and maintain consistent, granular AAA policy across all devices.

Where devices are primarily managed via Software Defined Networking or other centralized management and/or automation platforms rather than through the CLI or other local interfaces, then this may be sufficient to meet requirements for centralized AAA and/or allow for effective management of local template accounts without using external AAA.

Impact:

Careful configuration of permissions following the least privilege principle is essential for secure and reliable management of the network.

When configuring remote AAA, it is recommended that a local Emergency Access Account also be configured to allow management of the device in the event that AAA services are unavailable."

  description : "6.6.7 Ensure Remote Login Class for Authorization through External AAA - remote class"
  info        : "External AAA servers should be utilized to provide Authorization via a single 'Remote' template account.

Rationale:

JUNOS routers ship with 4 Predefined Login Classes for user Authorization, these are:

super-user

read-only

operator

unauthorized

These classes provide basic Authorization, restricting what users in each class can or cannot do, to allow organizations to get a router up and running, but do not provide fine grained control needed by all but very smallest organizations.

The built in classes also do not meet the other recommendations in this section. For example, the super-user class (which is the only built in class with read/write permissions) also has permission to start a Unix Shell and does not have an Idle Session Timeout.

Because of these limitations it is recommended that Custom Login Classes be defined following the principle of least privilege, where each class of users is granted only those permissions needed to complete their job role.

However, defining and maintaining Custom Login Classes locally on each router, switch, firewall or other network device can quickly become difficult and error prone in a larger environment.

For larger networks JUNOS provides for extremely fine grained access control rules to be defined on an External AAA server running either RADIUS or TACACS+ through the use of Vendor Specific Attributes which map to the same permissions that can be set locally for a class.

  description : "6.6.14 Ensure Multi-Factor is used with External AAA"
  info        : "Multi-factor Authentication should be used for management sessions

Rationale:

Even with the password complexity restrictions and use of External AAA servers for centralized control of user Authentication, login with usernames and passwords is commonly exploited through Phishing, Brute Force or other methods.

Multi-Factor Authentication (sometimes called Two-Factor Authentication or 2FA) provides a significant additional layer of security for management sessions by requiring a username, password and some further method/s to all be provided to login.

The additional factor may use an X.509 'SSL' Certificate, a Time Based One Time Password (TOTP), a physical security token, a Fingerprint or may use some other method or even combination of these methods.

In all the cases above, the additional factor provides a significant additional challenge to an attacker looking to successfully pose as the user and compromise the network.

Multi-Factor authentication is widely supported by most External AAA services, either using paid for services like RSA SecureID or free platforms like Google Authenticator, so is included here as a general recommendation relating to AAA and login. However, because the Multi-Factor Authentication is implemented on the AAA Server, it is not possible to include an audit action or include this as a scored recommendation.

Impact:

As with any AAA service, Multi-Factor Authentication should be carefully tested and you should ensure you maintain a local password as a backup method to ensure you are not locked out of your network while implementing such a service.

Default Value:

No External AAA or Multi-Factor Authentication is used by default.

Additional Information:

While SMS One Time Passwords is a valid Multi-Factor Authentication method and easily/cheaply implemented, the susceptibility of SMS to interception makes this one of the least strong methods and other factors should be employed where ever possible.

Rationale:

SSH (Secure Shell) is the defacto standard protocol used for remote administration of network devices and Unix servers, providing an encrypted and authenticated alternative to Telnet. However, this ubiquity and requirement to support a wide range of clients and deployment scenarios, as well as SSH's age, mean SSH needs to support a variety of Ciphers of varying strengths.

By default, for the widest range of client compatibility, JUNOS supports SSH Ciphers using older Encryption Algorithms such as Blowfish or RC4 which are no longer considered suitable for use to protect sensitive services like SSH.

NOTE - The OpenSSH implementation used in JUNOS is not fully compliant with Suite B SSH set out in RFC6239, but these standards have been used as guidance for setting the more restrictive Level 2 recommendation.

SSH is a vital tool for administering most JUNOS devices, providing privileged access and potentially transporting sensitive information including passwords. It is recommended that SSH sessions be protected by restricting JUNOS to using stronger Key Exchange methods recommended in the National Security Agency Suite B Standard.

Suite B standards for Cryptographic functions are developed and distributed by the US National Security Agency as part of Cryptographic Modernization Program for protection of US Government data, both unclassified and classified (to Secret). Suite B standards for SSH are set out in RFC6239 and restrict Key Exchange to Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman with NIST P Values and SHA2 only.

NOTE - The OpenSSH implementation used in JUNOS is not fully compliant with Suite B SSH set out in RFC6239, but these standards have been used as guidance for setting the more restrictive Level 2 recommendation.

Impact:

Some SSH Clients or other management applications or automation platforms utilizing SSH may not support the stronger Key Exchange Methods used in Suite B, so may be unable to connect.

Ensure that all applications are fully tested before deploying this recommendation in a production environment."
  solution    : "To remove a single non-Suite B Key Exchange method, issue the following command from the [edit system services ssh] hierarchy;

[edit system services ssh]
user@host# delete key-exchange <mac name>

If multiple insecure Key Exchange methods were set, it will generally be easier to delete all the Key Exchange method restrictions with the following command:

[edit system services ssh]
user@host# delete key-exchange

Once all insecure methods have been removed, add one or more stronger Key Exchange methods (in this example all Suite B methods available on most JUNOS devices are set in a single command)

[edit system services ssh]
user@host# set key-exchange [ ecdh-sha2-nistp256 ecdh-sha2-nistp384  ecdh-sha2-nistp512 ]

  description : "6.10.1.13 Ensure SSH Key Authentication is Disabled"
  info        : "SSH Key based Authentication should be disabled (if not used for automation)

Rationale:

Due to the sensitive nature of SSH, potentially allowing full management of the targeted device, protecting SSH access using strong authentication methods is essential to the security of the device.

One method which is supported in SSH for stronger authentication is the use of Public/Private Encryption Key Pairs in place of a more traditional login prompt for a Username and Password. Instead, an administrator uploads the user's Public key to the JUNOS (or other) device to be managed.

When the user connects, they will use their Private key to encrypt some session specific data. The JUNOS device can verify the Users identity by decrypting that data using the Public key configured previously and comparing it to an expected result. If the results match, then the user must have access to the Private key, so is considered valid.

Unfortunately using SSH Keys to authenticate User Logins to JUNOS devices introduce a number of security issues:

Public Keys may only be configured locally on each JUNOS device

Public Keys are used instead of centralized AAA using TACACS+ or RADIUS as covered in Recommendation 6.8.1 Ensure External AAA Server is set

The use of SSH Keys means only a single Authentication Factor (the keys) can be used, preventing the use of Multi Factor Authentication as covered in 6.6.14 Ensure Multi-Factor is used with External AAA

JUNOS does not provide any method to automate rollover or locking of keys. If keys are compromised/lost, they must be changed on every JUNOS device on which they are configured.

Some SSH implementation support the use of X.509 PKI Certificates for managing SSH Keys, but JUNOS does not.

Because of these limitations and the difficulty in auditing and managing SSH Keys on JUNOS devices, this method should not be used for Authentication of User logins or for the Root User.

Due to these limitations, it is recommended that SSH Key based Authentication be disabled when it is not required to support automation systems.

In some instances, such as when using PyEZ or NETCONF based automation over SSH, it may be preferable to authenticate a limited number of automation services using SSH Keys, rather than 'hard coding' user details into scripts. Where this is the case, then this recommendation should not be implemented as it disables all use of SSH Key based Authentication.

When using SSH Keys for automation, it is imperative to have strong key management procedures in use to control and audit access to the Private Keys used and a process to allow for rollover and revocation of compromised keys. Consider using a Centralized SSH Key Management solution when trying to achieve this at scale.

Impact:

Ensure that SSH Key based Authentication is not required for automation systems and that any User Logins previously using SSH Keys have been configured with an alternative authentication methods before disabling SSH Key based Authentication."

      info        : "JWeb should only be accessed using HTTPS with a PKI Certificate

Rationale:

JWeb can be configured to provide a Web GUI over either HTTP or HTTPS.

When configured to use HTTPS X.509 Certificates are used to:

Share Public Encryption Keys

Provide Identity Information

Validate the Web Server's Identity

Enforce Encryption Key Rollover by limiting their validity period

JWeb can be configured to use Self Signed 'System-Generated' X.509 Certificates, where the JUNOS device makes an identity claim, such as 'I am myrouter.myorg.com', without any external validation. When an administrator connects to JWeb their browser will generate a Security Error due to this lack of validation, which the user will need to accept in order to proceed to the interface.

Without validation from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), either an Internal or Public CA, administrators may be unable to detect when a management session is being intercepted or impersonated by an attacker. Additionally, a Self Signed certificate cannot be centrally revoked should a compromise be detected, relying instead on each user manually removing trust for the compromised Certificate.

A Certificate Authority is a Trusted Third Party which validates X.509 Certificates by signing them, using a secure Hashing algorithm and their own Private Key. A CA may be part of an organization's internal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or an Public CA service such as those provided by Verisign, Entrust or Microsoft.

Commonly, for signing Certificates used for internal management and systems, Organizations will configure their own PKI rather than paying for Public CA Services - configuring their End Points to trust Certificates signed by their CA through Group Policy or similar methods.

Either option is equally acceptable for use with JWeb, but Self Signed Certificates should not be used.

In addition, JUNOS offers two options for the storage and management of Certificates and their associated Private Keys:

in the configuration under the [edit security certificates] hierarchy

in a protected PKI store in memory

While the keys are hashed when stored in the configuration file, they are still exposed through backups and management access to the device. Storing Certificates and Keys in the device's PKI store means that the Private Keys are never accessible and that additional protections to this restricted area of memory can be used.

Due to these limitations PKI Certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority should always be used for JWeb Management and should always be stored in the device's PKI store rather than local configuration.

Impact:

Ensure an alternative method to manage the JUNOS device is configured and working prior to changing the Certificate used for HTTPS to ensure continued access in the event of any errors."

Where <Certificate ID> is the name of a Certificate which has already been loaded to the devices PKI Store.
To create a new Public/Private Key Pair in the devices PKI Store and generate Certificate Signing Request issue the following commands from Operational Mode:

user@host> request security pki generate-key-pair certificate-id <Certificate ID> type <Algorithm> size <Size>

<Algorithm> is the Encryption Algorithm to be used (this should be either RSA or ECC)

<Size> is the number of Bits used for the keys (use at least 2048bits for RSA or 256bits for ECC)

-<Device Subject DN> is the Distinguished Name used to identify this device and certificate.

Optionally, fields for email address, the device's IP Address and and output Filename for the PKCS#10 CSR which will be generated can be included.
The CSR should then be submitted to the Certificate Authority for review and signing.

By default, when configured, the JWeb service will listen for incoming connections on all interfaces which have an IP Address configured, exposing JWeb to users on all networks through which the device is reachable.

This can be accomplished by limiting the interfaces on which the JWeb HTTPS service operates to only include the devices' OOB Interface. Firewall Filters or Security Policy (SRX) should also be used to further restrict management to authorized sources (see Recommendations in Section 2 - Firewall for further details).

Some JUNOS devices do not have dedicated OOB Management ports. In some cases a 'revenue port' can be configured to act as a Management port, such as by defining a 'management' functional zone with a Branch/SME SRX Firewall.

Some JUNOS devices do not have dedicated OOB Management ports. In some cases a 'revenue port' can be configured to act as a Management port, such as by defining a 'management' functional zone with a Branch/SME SRX Firewall. This type of restricted OOB Management Port is accepted as meeting this recommendation, but is not tested for under the audit procedure as a variety of ports might be used.

Impact:

Ensure that JWeb Management is operational and reachable using the selected interfaces before applying interface restrictions in a production environment.

Rationale:

The JUNOS REST API can be configured for access using either HTTP or HTTPS for connections.

When configured to use HTTPS X.509 Certificates are used to:

Share Public Encryption Keys

Provide Identity Information

Validate the Web Server's Identity

Enforce Encryption Key Rollover by limiting their validity period

JWeb can be configured to use Self Signed 'System-Generated' X.509 Certificates, where the JUNOS device makes an identity claim, such as 'I am myrouter.myorg.com', without any external validation. When an administrator connects to JWeb their browser will generate a Security Error due to this lack of validation, which the user will need to accept in order to proceed to the interface.

Without validation from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), either an Internal or Public CA, administrators may be unable to detect when a management session is being intercepted or impersonated by an attacker. Additionally, a Self Signed certificate cannot be centrally revoked should a compromise be detected, relying instead on each user manually removing trust for the compromised Certificate.

A Certificate Authority is a Trusted Third Party which validates X.509 Certificates by signing them, using a secure Hashing algorithm and their own Private Key. A CA may be part of an organization's internal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or a Public CA service such as those provided by Verisign, Entrust or Microsoft.

Commonly, for signing Certificates used for internal management and systems, Organizations will configure their own PKI rather than paying for Public CA Services - configuring their End Points to trust Certificates signed by their CA through Group Policy or similar methods.

Either option is equally acceptable for use with JWeb, but Self Signed Certificates should not be used.

Impact:

REST API Management may be lost if the Certificate is not valid or issued from a Certificate Authority which the Network Management/Automation Systems are not configured to trust.

Rationale:

The JUNOS REST API can be configured for access using either HTTP or HTTPS for connections.

When configured to use HTTPS, X.509 Certificates are used to validate the JUNOS Devices identity to API Clients when they connect. Optionally, TLS Mutual Authentication may also be configured, whereby the REST API Client must also provide an X.509 Certificate signed by a mutually trusted Certificate Authority before it is permitted to connect.

Using a mutually trusted Certificate Authority (CA), either an Internal or Public CA, allows for both the Client Device (such as a Network Automation Server) and JUNOS Device to detect when a management session is being intercepted or impersonated by an attacker. Additionally, a centralized CA is able to revoke any Certificate's which may be compromised or have been issued to Clients who are no longer authorized.

A Certificate Authority is a Trusted Third Party which validates X.509 Certificates by signing them, using a secure Hashing algorithm and their own Private Key. A CA may be part of an organization's internal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or an Public CA service such as those provided by Verisign, Entrust or Microsoft.

Either option is equally acceptable for use REST TLS Mutual Authentication, but a ca-profile must be configured on the JUNOS Device (even where the device has preconfigured trust for some Public CAs).

TLS/HTTPS Mutual Authentication does not replace User Authentication, which is still performed via an HTTP Authentication Header using details configured Local or Remote (via RADIUS/TACACS+) User.

      info        : "The REST API should only be accessed using HTTPS with a PKI Certificate

Rationale:

The JUNOS REST API can be configured for access using either HTTP or HTTPS for connections.

When configured to use HTTPS X.509 Certificates are used to:

Share Public Encryption Keys

Provide Identity Information

Validate the Web Server's Identity

Enforce Encryption Key Rollover by limiting their validity period

JWeb can be configured to use Self Signed 'System-Generated' X.509 Certificates, where the JUNOS device makes an identity claim, such as 'I am myrouter.myorg.com', without any external validation. When an administrator connects to JWeb their browser will generate a Security Error due to this lack of validation, which the user will need to accept in order to proceed to the interface.

Without validation from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), either an Internal or Public CA, administrators may be unable to detect when a management session is being intercepted or impersonated by an attacker. Additionally, a Self Signed certificate cannot be centrally revoked should a compromise be detected, relying instead on each user manually removing trust for the compromised Certificate.

A Certificate Authority is a Trusted Third Party which validates X.509 Certificates by signing them, using a secure Hashing algorithm and their own Private Key. A CA may be part of an organization's internal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or a Public CA service such as those provided by Verisign, Entrust or Microsoft.

Commonly, for signing Certificates used for internal management and systems, Organizations will configure their own PKI rather than paying for Public CA Services - configuring their End Points to trust Certificates signed by their CA through Group Policy or similar methods.

Either option is equally acceptable for use with JWeb, but Self Signed Certificates should not be used.

Impact:

REST API Management may be lost if the Certificate is not valid or issued from a Certificate Authority which the Network Management/Automation Systems are not configured to trust.

      info        : "The REST HTTPS API should be configured for Mutual Authentication

Rationale:

The JUNOS REST API can be configured for access using either HTTP or HTTPS for connections.

When configured to use HTTPS, X.509 Certificates are used to validate the JUNOS Devices identity to API Clients when they connect. Optionally, TLS Mutual Authentication may also be configured, whereby the REST API Client must also provide an X.509 Certificate signed by a mutually trusted Certificate Authority before it is permitted to connect.

Using a mutually trusted Certificate Authority (CA), either an Internal or Public CA, allows for both the Client Device (such as a Network Automation Server) and JUNOS Device to detect when a management session is being intercepted or impersonated by an attacker. Additionally, a centralized CA is able to revoke any Certificate's which may be compromised or have been issued to Clients who are no longer authorized.

A Certificate Authority is a Trusted Third Party which validates X.509 Certificates by signing them, using a secure Hashing algorithm and their own Private Key. A CA may be part of an organization's internal Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or an Public CA service such as those provided by Verisign, Entrust or Microsoft.

Commonly, for signing Certificates used for internal management and systems, Organizations will configure their own PKI rather than paying for Public CA Services - configuring their End Points to trust Certificates signed by their CA through Group Policy or similar methods.

Either option is equally acceptable for use REST TLS Mutual Authentication, but a ca-profile must be configured on the JUNOS Device (even where the device has preconfigured trust for some Public CAs).

TLS/HTTPS Mutual Authentication does not replace User Authentication, which is still performed via an HTTP Authentication Header using details configured Local or Remote (via RADIUS/TACACS+) User.

Impact:

REST API Management may be lost if the Certificate is not valid or if Automation/Network Management Systems using the REST API are not also configured to support Mutual Authentication using valid Certificates from the same Certificate Authority.

  description     : "6.12.2 Ensure At Least 2 External SYSLOG Hosts are Set with Any/Info"
  info            : "Logging data must be sent to at least two external SYSLOG servers.

Rationale:

Log information from a JUNOS Device can be vital in detecting an attack and to allow incidents to be analyzed, investigated and (where appropriate) prosecuted. SYSLOG information is also helpful in diagnosing and resolving non-security related operational issues on the network.

Because of this, one of the first tasks an attacker will attempt to accomplish after gaining access to a Network Device is to alter or delete logs to cover their tracks.

To prevent an attacker or a fault denying you access to log data, it is vital to send logs to at least one External Logging and/or SIEM (Security Incident and Event Manager) Server. JUNOS Devices use the industry standard SYSLOG protocol for this.

SYSLOG entries are generated by a range of sources on a JUNOS Device, such as authorization which reports Authentication and Authorization events or PFE for events encountered by the Packet Forwarding Engine. Each of these sources are referred to as a Facility.

In addition to indicating what facility generated a log message, JUNOS SYSLOG also indicates and allows the administrator to filter based on the Severity Level for each message. There are eight possible levels, which are as follows:

Emergency (0)

Alert (1)

Critical (2)

Error (3)

Warning (4)

Notice (5)

Informational (6)

Any (7) (called Debug on many SYSLOG systems)

Each increase in level represents an increase in the detail and number of log messages created. Each level includes the messages from all preceding levels, so Critical includes all messages from both the Alert and Emergency levels.

To ensure that vital messages about the Health and Security of the JUNOS Device are not missed, or lost should an attacker delete local logs, at least two External SYSLOG or SIEM Servers should be configured to receive log messages from any Facility and at least info Severity.

SYSLOG messages are sent in a 'fire and forget' manner over UDP, with no acknowledgement or ability to resend missed messages in the event a server is unable to handle them. Adding a second server significantly reduces the risk that messages are lost in the event of a network or server issue.

Impact:

Network Devices, particularly Firewalls, can generate a significant volumes of log data, it is essential that the target SYSLOG servers are suitably resourced to handle the expected volume of messages and it is strongly recommended that robust archiving and retention processes be employed."
  solution        : "SYSLOG data is recorded locally by default, you can configure external SYSLOG servers by issuing the following commands from the [edit system syslog] hierarchy;

[edit system syslog]

user@host# set host <Server 2> any <Severity>

Where:

<Server 1> is the IP Address or Fully Qualified Domain Name of the first Remote SYSLOG or SIEM Server

<Server 2> is the IP Address or FQDN of a separate second Remote SYSLOG or SIEM Server. For added resilience, you may wish to place the second server on a different network to the first and this is recommended where possible.

<Severity> should be either any or info

Some SYSLOG or SIEM Servers may require additional configuration items such as explicit-priority or structured-data options to be configured.
It is possible to filter SYSLOG messages to be forwarded to the host using a match or match-string condition. This should not be set for the device's the Remote SYSLOG Hosts configured in meeting this Recommendation.
