A new SA is negotiated before the lifetime threshold of the existing SA is reached to ensure that a new SA is ready for use when the old one expires. The longer the lifetime of the IPsec SA, the longer the lifetime of the session key used to protect IP traffic. The SA is less secure with a longer lifetime because an attacker has a greater opportunity to collect traffic encrypted by the same key and subject it to cryptanalysis. However, a shorter lifetime causes IPsec peers to renegotiate Phase II more often resulting in the expenditure of additional resources."

These resources are wasted during periods of IPsec endpoint inactivity, which could result in the gateway's inability to create new SAs for other endpoints, thereby preventing new sessions from connecting.

An IPsec SA is established using either Internet Key Exchange (IKE) or manual configuration.

With manual configuration of the IPsec security association, both the cipher key and authentication key are static. Hence, if the keys are compromised, the traffic being protected by the current IPsec tunnel can be decrypted as well as traffic in any future tunnels established by this SA. Furthermore, the peers are not authenticated prior to establishing the SA, which could result in a rogue device establishing an IPsec SA with either of the VPN end points.

Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors). Organizational users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses except the following.

(i) Accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization. Organizations document specific user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication; and

(ii) Accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.

This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN or proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of configuring the device itself (i.e., device management).

Multifactor authentication uses two or more factors to achieve authentication. Use of password for user remote access for non-privileged account is not authorized.

Factors include:

A non-privileged account is any information system account with authorizations of a non-privileged user.

  info        : "Split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information.

A VPN hardware or software client with split tunneling enabled provides an unsecured backdoor to the enclave from the Internet. With split tunneling enabled, a remote client has access to the Internet while at the same time has established a secured path to the enclave via an IPsec tunnel. A remote client connected to the Internet that has been compromised by an attacker in the Internet, provides an attack base to the enclave's private network via the IPsec tunnel. Hence, it is imperative that the VPN gateway enforces a no split-tunneling policy to all remote clients.
