  "info": "The rsh-client package contains the client commands for the rsh services.\n\nThese legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh-client package removes the clients for rsh rcp and rlogin",
  "solution": "\"Uninstall rsh :\n\n# apt purge rsh-client",
  "Impact": "Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional misuse.\"",
