  "info": "libpwquality provides common functions for password quality checking and scoring them based on their apparent randomness. The library also provides a function for generating random passwords with good pronounceability.\n\nThis module can be plugged into the password stack of a given service to provide some plug-in strength-checking for passwords. The code was originally based on pam_cracklib module and the module is backwards compatible with its options.\n\nStrong passwords reduce the risk of systems being hacked through brute force methods.",
