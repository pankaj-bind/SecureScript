  "description": "1.111 (L2) Ensure 'Enhanced Security Mode configuration for Intranet zone sites' is set to 'Disabled'",
  "info": "This policy setting controls whether Microsoft Edge will apply enhanced security mode on Intranet zone sites. Enhanced security mode in Microsoft Edge mitigates memory-related vulnerabilities by disabling just-in-time (JIT) JavaScript compilation and enabling additional operating system protections for the browser.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nEnhanced security mode provides 'defense-in-depth' protection that makes it more difficult for a malicious site to use an unpatched vulnerability to write to executable memory.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Edge\\Enhanced Security Mode configuration for Intranet zone sites",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template MSEdge.admx/adml that can be downloaded from:\n\nDownload Microsoft Edge for Business - Microsoft\n\n.",
  "Impact": "Disabling this setting could lead to Intranet zone sites acting in an unexpected manner.\"",
