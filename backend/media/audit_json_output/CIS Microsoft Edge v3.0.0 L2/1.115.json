  "description": "1.115 (L2) Ensure 'Live captions allowed' is set to 'Disabled'",
  "info": "This policy setting allows users to turn live captions on or off. Live captions are an accessibility feature that converts speech from the audio that plays in Microsoft Edge to text and shows this text in a separate window.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nEnabling live captions could allow data to be transmitted to a third-party, which could lead to sensitive data being exposed.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Edge\\Live captions allowed",
  "Note": "An exception to this recommendation might be needed as this is an accessibility feature that is legitimately needed by some users. Take this into consideration when applying this setting.\"",
  "Impact": "Users won't be able to turn live captions on. In addition, if speech recognition files have been downloaded previously, they will be deleted from the device in 30 days.",
