  "description": "1.30 (L2) Ensure 'Allow file selection dialogs' is set to 'Disabled'",
  "info": "This policy setting allows access to local files by allowing file selection dialogs in Microsoft Edge.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nAllowing users to import favorites, uploading files, and savings links could pose potential security risks by allowing data to be uploaded to external sites or by downloading malicious files. By not allowing the file selection dialog the end-user will not be prompted for uploads/downloads, preventing data exfiltration and possible system infection by malware.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Edge\\Allow file selection dialogs",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template MSEdge.admx/adml that can be downloaded from:\n\nDownload Microsoft Edge for Business - Microsoft\n\n.",
  "Impact": "Users will no longer be prompted when performing actions which would trigger a file selection dialog. Instead, the file selection dialog box assumes the user clicked 'Cancel'. Being as this is not the default behavior, impact to the user will be noticeable, and the user will not be able to upload and download files.\"",
