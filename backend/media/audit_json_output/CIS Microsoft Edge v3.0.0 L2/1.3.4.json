  "info": "This policy setting determines whether websites can ask for read access to the host operating system's file system using the File System API.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Don't allow any site to request read access to files and directories via the File System API\n\nThere is a large category of attack vectors that are opened up by allowing web applications access to files. By setting this policy to Enabled: Don't allow any site to request read access to files and directories implements additional protections to safeguard against accidental sharing of sensitive information contained in locals files.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Don't allow any site to request read access to files and directories via the File System API :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Edge\\Content settings\\Control use of the File System API for reading",

  "Impact": "Users with creative roles that require the File System API access permission to read files for photo, video, and text editors or for creating integrated development environments will need additional permissions granted based on their role.\"",
