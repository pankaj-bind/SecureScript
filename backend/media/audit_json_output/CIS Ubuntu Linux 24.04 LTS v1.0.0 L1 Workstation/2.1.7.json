  "info": "The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was introduced as a replacement for NIS/YP. It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central database.\n\nIf the system will not need to act as an LDAP server, it is recommended that the software be removed to reduce the potential attack surface.",
  "solution": "\"Run the following commands to stop slapd.service and remove the slapd package:\n\n# systemctl stop slapd.service\n# apt purge slapd\n\n- OR -\n\n- IF - the slapd package is required as a dependency:\n\nRun the following commands to stop and mask slapd.service :\n\n# systemctl stop slapd.service\n# systemctl mask slapd.service",
