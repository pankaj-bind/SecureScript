      "Note": "Most such passwords will not pass the simplicity check unless the sequence is only a minor part of the password.\n\nUse of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.\n\nPassword complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.\"",
