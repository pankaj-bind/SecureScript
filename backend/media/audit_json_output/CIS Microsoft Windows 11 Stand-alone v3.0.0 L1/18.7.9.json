  "info": "This policy setting manages how queue-specific files are processed during printer installation. At printer installation time, a vendor-supplied installation application can specify a set of files, of any type, to be associated with a particular print queue. The files are downloaded to each client that connects to the print server.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Limit Queue-specific files to Color profiles\n\nA Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (\n\nCVE-2021-36958\n\n) exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges and then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
