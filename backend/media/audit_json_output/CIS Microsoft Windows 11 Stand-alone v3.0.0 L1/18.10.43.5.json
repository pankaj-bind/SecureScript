  "info": "\"This policy setting allows you to decide how the clipboard behaves while in Microsoft Defender Application Guard.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enable clipboard operation from an isolated session to the host",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template AppHVSI.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1703 Administrative Templates (or newer).\n\nNote #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named\n\nConfigure Windows Defender Application Guard clipboard settings: Clipboard behavior setting\n\n, but it was renamed to\n\nConfigure Microsoft Defender Application Guard clipboard settings: Clipboard behavior setting\n\nstarting with the Windows 10 Release 2004 Administrative Templates.",

  "Impact": "Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Application Guard sessions will not be able to access the host device's clipboard, however the host device will be able to access the Microsoft Defender Application Guard session clipboard.\"",
