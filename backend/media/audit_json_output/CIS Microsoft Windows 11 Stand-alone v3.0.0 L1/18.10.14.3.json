The security question feature does not apply to domain accounts, only local accounts on the workstation.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nUsers could establish security questions that are easily guessed or sleuthed by observing the user's social media accounts, making it easier for a malicious actor to change the local user account password and gain access to the computer as that user account.",
