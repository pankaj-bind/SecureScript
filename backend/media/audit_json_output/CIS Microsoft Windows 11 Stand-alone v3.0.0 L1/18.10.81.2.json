  "info": "This policy setting controls whether a device will automatically sign-in the last interactive user after Windows Update restarts the system.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nDisabling this feature will prevent the caching of user's credentials and unauthorized use of the device, and also ensure the user is aware of the restart.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Logon Options\\Sign-in and lock last interactive user automatically after a restart",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template WinLogon.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 &amp; Server 2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer).\n\nNote #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named\n\nSign-in last interactive user automatically after a system-initiated restart\n\n, but it was renamed starting with the Windows 10 Release 1903 Administrative Templates.",
  "Impact": "The device does not store the user's credentials for automatic sign-in after a Windows Update restart. The users' lock screen apps are not restarted after the system restarts. The user is required to present the logon credentials in order to proceed after restart.\"",
