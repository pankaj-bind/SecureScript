  "info": "\"This policy setting controls whether the Local Security Authority Subservice Service (LSASS) runs in protected mode and also has the option to lock in protected mode with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). The Local Security Authority (LSA), which includes the LSASS process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled with UEFI Lock",
  "Note": "This additional protection to prevent reading memory and code injection by non-protected processes is supported by Windows 8.1 (or newer).\n\nProvides added security for the credentials that LSA stores and manages. Enabling this setting with UEFI Lock prevents the setting from being changed remotely.\"",
