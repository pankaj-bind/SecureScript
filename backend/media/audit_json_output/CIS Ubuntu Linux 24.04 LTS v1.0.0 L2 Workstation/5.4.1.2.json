If not specified, 0 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).\n\nUsers may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old, potentially compromised passwords, may cause a security breach.\n\nBy restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls",

This may cause a user to continue to use a password created by other personnel.\"",
