  "info": "\"Chrome provides a Cleanup feature to detect unwanted software. If this setting is Enabled the results of the cleanup may be shared with Google (based on the setting of\n\nSafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled\n\n) to assist with future unwanted software detection. These results will contain file metadata, automatically installed extensions, and registry keys.\n\nIf the setting is Disabled the results of the cleanup will not be shared with Google regardless of the value of\n\nSafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled\n\n.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled (0)",
