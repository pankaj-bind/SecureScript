  "info": "This setting controls the defaults for clipboard permission access from sites. It can be configured to either:\n\n - Disabled (2): Does not allow access to the clipboard site permission by any site\n - Enabled (3): Sites ask the user to allow access to the clipboard site permission\n\nIf the value for DefaultClipboardSetting is not changed from the default, it will behave as if it is enabled. ClipboardAllowedForUrls or ClipboardBlockedForUrls will override this setting for any site that matches the configured URL patterns.\n\nWith the setting disabled, organizations will need to set ClipboardAllowedForUrls for any URLs they want to make exempt.\n\nThe clipboard stores data, text, and images that are shared between all applications. An organization would disable clipboard access to restrict sites from reading the contents of the clipboard when visiting.",
