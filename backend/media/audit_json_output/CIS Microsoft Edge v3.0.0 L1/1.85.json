  "description": "1.85 (L1) Ensure 'Enable AutoFill for payment instructions' is set to 'Disabled'",
  "info": "This policy setting controls whether users can utilize payment information, such as credit or debit cards in web forms using previously stored information.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nHaving payment information stored and auto filled in Microsoft Edge could allow for an attacker to gain access to this sensitive data.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Microsoft Edge\\Enable AutoFill for payment instructions",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template MSEdge.admx/adml that can be downloaded from:\n\nDownload Microsoft Edge for Business - Microsoft\n\n.\n\nNote #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named\n\nAutoFill for credit cards\n\n, but it was renamed to\n\nEnable AutoFill for payment instructions\n\n.",
  "Impact": "Users will be unable to use and store AutoFill data for credit and debit card information in Microsoft Edge.\"",
