These ads can pop up unexpectedly, block the host page, open new pages and windows, or play video and audio at inopportune times.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block ads on sites with intrusive ads.\n\nIntrusive ads are ads found on websites that are invasive or unwelcome. These ads can contain malicious files or can fool an unknowing user into giving away their username and/or password.",
