  "info": "This policy setting configures the use of generated browser themes using DALL-E and apply them to Microsoft Edge. DALL-E is an open Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that creates realistic images and art from text descriptions (prompts).\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nThe rush to bring GenAI to market has brought to light concerns about the training data rapidly ingested by these large language models (LLMs). Content creators have complained copyright infringement on the content generated by these products. This has resulted in lawsuits against major corporations the results of which may shape future laws and regulations about the use of certain products and/or the content created by them.\n\nDue to this, there is an unknown element of risk involved in utilizing content generated by DALL-E in an enterprise environment and it is therefore recommended to disable this setting to mitigate that future risk around intellectual property.",
