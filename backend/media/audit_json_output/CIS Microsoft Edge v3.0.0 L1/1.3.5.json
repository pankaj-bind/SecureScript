  "info": "This policy setting specifies whether websites can ask for write access to the host operating system's filesystem using the File System API. By default, websites can ask for access. Users can change this setting. By setting this policy to (2), access is denied.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Don't allow any site to request write access to files and directories\n\nThere is a large category of attack vectors that are opened up by allowing web applications access to files. By setting this policy to Enabled: Don't allow any site to request write access to files and directories implements additional protection to safeguard against accidental sharing of sensitive information contained in local files.",
