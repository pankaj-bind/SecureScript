  "info": "An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user without providing a password.\n\nAll accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user.",
  "solution": "If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:\n\n# passwd -l <username>\n\nAlso, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off.",
