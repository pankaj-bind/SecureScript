  "info": "This setting controls whether Windows Media Player is allowed to download additional codecs for decoding media files it does not already understand.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nThis has some potential for risk if a malicious data file is opened in Media Player that requires an additional codec to be installed. If a special codec is required for a necessary job function, then that codec should first be tested to ensure it is legitimate, and it should be supplied by the IT department in the organization.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled:\n\nUser Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Media Player\\Playback\\Prevent Codec Download",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template WindowsMediaPlayer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.",
  "Impact": "Windows Media Player is prevented from automatically downloading codecs to your computer. In addition, the\n\nDownload codecs automatically\n\ncheck box on the Player tab in the Player is not available.\"",
