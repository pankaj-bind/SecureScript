  "description": "5.2 (L2) Ensure 'Bluetooth Support Service (bthserv)' is set to 'Disabled'",
  "info": "The Bluetooth service supports discovery and association of remote Bluetooth devices.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nBluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard. Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not being able to use Bluetooth devices.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration, run the following PowerShell command:\n\nSet-Service -Name bthserv -StartupType Disabled",
  "Impact": "Already installed Bluetooth devices may fail to operate properly and new devices may be prevented from being discovered or associated. If Bluetooth devices were installed, then some Windows components, such as Devices and Printers, may fail to operate correctly - including hanging/freezing when opened. The solution, besides re-enabling this service, is to disable or delete the offending Bluetooth device(s) in Device Manager, or disable the device altogether via the system BIOS (if it is an on-board Bluetooth device).\"",
