  "description": "18.6.19.2.1 (L2) Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)')",
  "info": "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)\n\nSince the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.\n\nConfiguring this recommendation to the CIS suggested state mitigates\n\nCVE-2024-38063\n\n, a TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.",
  "solution": "'To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD) :",
  "HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\TCPIP6\\\\Parameters": "DisabledComponents",
  "Note": "This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.'",
  "Impact": "Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.\n\nThis registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852:\n\nHow to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows\n\n.",
