  "info": "This setting determines whether hash values are computed for files scanned by Microsoft Defender.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nWhen running an antivirus solution such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is important to ensure that it is configured to monitor for suspicious and known malicious activity. File hashes are a reliable way of detecting changes to files, and can speed up the scan process by skipping files that have not changed since they were last scanned and determined to be safe. A changed file hash can also be cause for additional scrutiny.",

  "Note": "The impact of this setting should be monitored closely during deployment to ensure user and system performance impact is within acceptable limits.\"",
  "Impact": "This setting could cause performance degradation during initial deployment and for users where new executable content is frequently being created (such as software developers), or where applications are frequently installed or updated.\n\nFor more information on this setting, please visit\n\nSecurity baseline (FINAL): Windows 10 and Windows Server, version 2004 - Microsoft Tech Community - 1543631\n\n.",
