  "info": "This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each boot-start driver:\n\n - Good : The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.\n - Bad : The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do not allow known bad drivers to be initialized.\n - Bad, but required for boot : The driver has been identified as malware, but the computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.\n - Unknown : This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver.\n\nIf you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to initialize the next time the computer is started.\n\nIf your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but critical\n\nThis policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already infected your system.",
