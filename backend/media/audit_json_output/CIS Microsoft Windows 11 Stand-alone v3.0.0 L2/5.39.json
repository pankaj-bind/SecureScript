  "info": "Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes them.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nFeatures that enable inbound network connections increase the attack surface. In a high security environment, management of secure workstations should be handled locally.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Disabled\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\System Services\\Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)",
  "Impact": "The ability to remotely manage the system with WinRM will be lost.",
  "Note": "Many remote administration tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), may require the WinRM service to be operational for remote management.\"",
