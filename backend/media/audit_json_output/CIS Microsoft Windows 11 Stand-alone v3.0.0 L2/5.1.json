  "info": "Service supporting the audio gateway role of the Bluetooth Handsfree Profile.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nBluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard. Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not being able to use Bluetooth devices.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\System Services\\Bluetooth Audio Gateway Service",
  "Note": "This service was first introduced in Windows 10 Release 1803. It appears to have replaced the older\n\nBluetooth Handsfree Service (BthHFSrv)\n\n, which was removed from Windows in that release (it is not simply a rename, but a different service).",
  "Impact": "Bluetooth hands-free devices will not function properly with the computer.\"",
