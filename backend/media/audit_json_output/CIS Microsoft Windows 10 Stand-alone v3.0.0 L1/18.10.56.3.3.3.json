  "info": "This policy setting prevents users from sharing the local drives on their client computers to Remote Desktop Servers that they access. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree in Windows Explorer in the following format:\n\n\\\\TSClient\\<driveletter>$\n\nIf local drives are shared they are left vulnerable to intruders who want to exploit the data that is stored on them.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nData could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's local computer without any direct user interaction. Malicious software already present on a compromised server would have direct and stealthy disk access to the user's local computer during the Remote Desktop session.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\Device and Resource Redirection\\Do not allow drive redirection",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template TerminalServer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.",
  "Impact": "Drive redirection will not be possible. In most situations, traditional network drive mapping to file shares (including administrative shares) performed manually by the connected user will serve as a capable substitute to still allow file transfers when needed.\"",
