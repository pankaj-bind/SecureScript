  "info": "\"This policy setting lets you prevent apps and features from working with files on OneDrive using the Next Generation Sync Client.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nEnabling this setting prevents users from accidentally (or intentionally) uploading confidential or sensitive corporate information to the OneDrive cloud service using the Next Generation Sync Client.",
  "Note": "If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users from saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive.\n\nNote #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest OneDrive client, as noted\n\nat this link\n\n(this template is not included with the Windows Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that template are worth your consideration:\n\n -\n\nAllow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations\n\n- a computer-based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant IDs.\n -\n\nPrevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts\n\n- a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).\"",

  "Impact": "Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store apps can't access OneDrive using the WinRT API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud. Users can't automatically upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.",
