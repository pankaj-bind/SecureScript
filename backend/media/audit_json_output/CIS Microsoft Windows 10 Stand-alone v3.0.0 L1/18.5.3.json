  "info": "IP source routing is a mechanism that allows the sender to determine the IP route that a datagram should take through the network. It is recommended to configure this setting to Not Defined for enterprise environments and to Highest Protection for high security environments to completely disable source routing.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled\n\nAn attacker could use source routed packets to obscure their identity and location. Source routing allows a computer that sends a packet to specify the route that the packet takes.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\MSS (Legacy)\\MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path does not exist by default. An additional Group Policy template ( MSS-legacy.admx/adml ) is required - it is available from this TechNet blog post:\n\nThe MSS settings - Microsoft Security Guidance blog",
  "Impact": "All incoming source routed packets will be dropped.\"",
