Using this value disables the\n\nOptional diagnostic data\n\ncontrol in the Settings app.\n\n -\n\nA value of (3) Send optional diagnostic data Additional diagnostic data is collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make product improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when you choose to send optional diagnostic data. Optional diagnostic data can also include diagnostic log files and crash dumps. Use the\n\nLimit Dump Collection\n\nand the\n\nLimit Diagnostic Log Collection\n\npolicies for more granular control of what optional diagnostic data is sent.\n\nWindows telemetry settings apply to the Windows operating system and some first party apps. This setting does not apply to third party apps running on Windows 10/11.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not recommended) or Enabled: Send required diagnostic data",
