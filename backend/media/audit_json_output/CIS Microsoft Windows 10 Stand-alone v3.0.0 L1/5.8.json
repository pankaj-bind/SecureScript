  "info": "Provides network access translation, addressing, name resolution and/or intrusion prevention services for a home or small office network.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nInternet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a feature that allows someone to 'share' their Internet connection with other machines on the network - it was designed for home or small office environments where only one machine has Internet access - it effectively turns that machine into an Internet router. This feature causes the bridging of networks and likely bypassing other, more secure pathways. It should not be used on any enterprise-managed system.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Disabled\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\System Services\\Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)",
  "Impact": "Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) will not be available. Wireless connections using Miracast will also be prevented.",
  "Note": "This service is a prerequisite for the\n\nMicrosoft Defender Application Guard\n\nfeature in Windows 10, so an exception should be made to this recommendation if intending to use Microsoft Defender Application Guard.\n\nNote #2: If your organization is using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) this service is needed for WSL to function, so an exception should be made to this recommendation.
