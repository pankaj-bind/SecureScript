  "info": "\"Maintains an updated list of computers on the network and supplies this list to computers designated as browsers.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed",
  "Note": "In Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, this service is bundled with the\n\nSMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support\n\noptional feature. As a result, removing that feature (highly recommended unless backward compatibility is needed to XP/2003 and older Windows OSes - see\n\nStop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft\n\n) will also remediate this recommendation. The feature is not installed by default starting with Windows 10 R1709.\n\nThis is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their network shares in the environment (i.e. 'Network Neighborhood'). If enabled, it generates a lot of unnecessary traffic, including 'elections' to see who gets to be the 'master browser'. This noisy traffic could also aid malicious attackers in discovering online machines, because the service also allows anyone to 'browse' for shared resources without any authentication. This service used to be running by default in older Windows versions (e.g. Windows XP), but today it only remains for backward compatibility for very old software that requires it.\"",
