  "info": "This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nUsers have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop Services allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\Security\\Always prompt for password upon connection",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template TerminalServer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.\n\nNote #2: In the Microsoft Windows Vista Administrative Templates, this setting was named\n\nAlways prompt client for password upon connection\n\n, but it was renamed starting with the Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) Administrative Templates.",
  "Impact": "Users cannot automatically log on to Remote Desktop Services by supplying their passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. They will be prompted for a password to log on.\"",
