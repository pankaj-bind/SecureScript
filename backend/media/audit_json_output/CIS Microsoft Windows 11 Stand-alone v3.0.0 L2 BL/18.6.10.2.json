  "info": "The Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) allows for distributed resolution of a name to an IPv6 address and port number. The protocol operates in the context of\n\nclouds\n\n. A cloud is a set of peer computers that can communicate with each other by using the same IPv6 scope.\n\nPeer-to-Peer protocols allow for applications in the areas of RTC, collaboration, content distribution and distributed processing.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nThis setting enhances the security of the environment and reduces the overall risk exposure related to peer-to-peer networking.",
