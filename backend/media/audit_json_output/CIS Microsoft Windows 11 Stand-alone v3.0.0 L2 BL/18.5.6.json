  "description": "18.5.6 (L2) Ensure 'MSS: (KeepAliveTime) How often keep-alive packets are sent in milliseconds' is set to 'Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes'",
  "info": "This value controls how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact by sending a keep-alive packet. If the remote computer is still reachable, it acknowledges the keep-alive packet.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes\n\nAn attacker who is able to connect to network applications could establish numerous connections to cause a DoS condition.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\MSS (Legacy)\\MSS: (KeepAliveTime) How often keep-alive packets are sent in milliseconds",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path does not exist by default. An additional Group Policy template ( MSS-legacy.admx/adml ) is required - it is available from this TechNet blog post:\n\nThe MSS settings - Microsoft Security Guidance blog",
  "Impact": "Keep-alive packets are not sent by default by Windows. However, some applications may configure the TCP stack flag that requests keep-alive packets. For such configurations, you can lower this value from the default setting of two hours to five minutes to disconnect inactive sessions more quickly.\"",
