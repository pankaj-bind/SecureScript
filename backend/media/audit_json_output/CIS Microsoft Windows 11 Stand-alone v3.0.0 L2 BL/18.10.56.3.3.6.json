  "info": "This policy setting allows you to control the redirection of supported Plug and Play devices, such as Windows Portable Devices, to the remote computer in a Remote Desktop Services session.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nIn a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack surface. The need for Plug and Play device redirection within a Remote Desktop session is very rare, so makes sense to reduce the number of unexpected avenues for data exfiltration and/or malicious code transfer.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\Device and Resource Redirection\\Do not allow supported Plug and Play device redirection",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template TerminalServer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.",
  "Impact": "Users in a Remote Desktop Services session will not be able to redirect their supported (local client) Plug and Play devices to the remote computer.\"",
