  "info": "This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.\n\nSelect 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True (checked).\n\nAdministrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.\n\nAdditionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.\n\nTo use BitLocker a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for removable drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.",
