  "info": "This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on operating system drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.\n\nYou can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nFrom a security perspective hardware-based encryption may introduce vulnerabilities in the hardware encryption of certain self-encrypting drives (SEDs), if the vendor and/or user has not updated the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. For more information visit\n\nADV180028 - Security Update Guide - Microsoft - Guidance for configuring BitLocker to enforce software encryption\n\n.",
