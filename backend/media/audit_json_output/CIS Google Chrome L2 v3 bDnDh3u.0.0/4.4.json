  "info": "\"This setting allows administrators to set whether the end-user is prompted for access to audio capture devices.\n\n - Disabled (0): Turns off prompts and audio capture will only work for URLs configured in the\n\nAudioCaptureAllowedUrls\n\nlist.\n - Enabled (1): With the exception of URLs set in the\n\nAudioCaptureAllowedUrls\n\nlist, users get prompted for audio capture access.",
  "NOTE": "The setting affects all audio input (not just the built-in microphone).\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled\n\nThe end-user having the ability to allow or deny audio capture for websites in Google Chrome could open an organization up to a malicious site that may capture proprietary information through the browser. By limiting or disallowing audio capture, it removes the end-user's discretion, leaving it up to the organization which sites are allowed to use this ability.\"",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via Group Policy, set the following UI path to Disabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Google\\Google Chrome\\Allow or deny audio capture",
  "Impact": "If you disable this setting, users will not be prompted for audio devices when using websites which may need this access, such as a web-based conferencing system. If there are sites which access will be allowed, configuration of the\n\nAudioCaptureAllowedUrls\n\nsetting will be necessary.\"",
