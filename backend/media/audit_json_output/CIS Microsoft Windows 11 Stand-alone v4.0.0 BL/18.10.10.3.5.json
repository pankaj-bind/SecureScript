This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.\n\nIn \\'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information\\' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not allow 256-bit recovery key\n\nAdministrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.\n\nAdditionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.\n\nTo use BitLocker a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for removable drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.'",
