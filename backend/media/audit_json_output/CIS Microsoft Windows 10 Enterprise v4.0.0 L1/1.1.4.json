  "description": "1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'",
  "info": "'This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \\'passphrase\\' is a better term than \\'password.\\' In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \\'I want to drink a $5 milkshake\\' is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization\\'s business requirements.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s)",
  "Note": "Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require long passwords.\"",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or more character(s) :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Minimum password length",
  "Impact": "Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.",
