  "Note": "A Windows 10 R1607, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.\n\nNote #2: This setting was originally only supported on Windows 10 R1607 or newer, then support for it was added to Windows 7 or newer via the March 2017 security patches.\n\nNote #3: If your organization is using Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)), the (organization-named) Defender for Identity Directory Service Account (DSA), will also need to be granted the same Remote Access: Allow permission. For more information on adding the service account please see\n\nConfigure SAM-R to enable lateral movement path detection in Microsoft Defender for Identity | Microsoft Docs\n\n.\n\nTo ensure that an unauthorized user cannot anonymously list local account names or groups and use the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks.
