  "info": "This subcategory reports other logon/logoff-related events, such as Remote Desktop Services session disconnects and reconnects, using RunAs to run processes under a different account, and locking and unlocking a workstation. Events for this subcategory include:\n\n - 4649: A replay attack was detected.\n - 4778: A session was reconnected to a Window Station.\n - 4779: A session was disconnected from a Window Station.\n - 4800: The workstation was locked.\n - 4801: The workstation was unlocked.\n - 4802: The screen saver was invoked.\n - 4803: The screen saver was dismissed.\n - 5378: The requested credentials delegation was disallowed by policy.\n - 5632: A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.\n - 5633: A request was made to authenticate to a wired network.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure\n\nAuditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Success and Failure :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Logon/Logoff\\Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events",
  "Impact": "If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected, or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.\"",
