  "info": "\"This policy setting controls whether the Local Security Authority Subservice Service (LSASS) runs in protected mode and also has the option to lock in protected mode with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). The Local Security Authority (LSA), which includes the LSASS process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled with UEFI Lock",

It is provided by the Group Policy template LocalSecurityAuthority.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 22H2 Administrative Templates v1.0 (or newer).\n\nNote #2: In the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 23H2 Administrative Templates, the registry location of",

This same registry location and value was also created if the setting\n\nEnsure 'LSA Protection' is set to 'Enabled'\n\nwas also applied.

To fix this issue, the ADMX/ADML templates must be updated to the latest version, the setting removed from the GPO, and then added back in.\n\nIf the Microsoft Windows 10 Benchmark is applied,\n\nLSA Protection\n\nis configured via a separate recommendation for older versions of the Windows 10 Operating System using the SecGuide.admx/adml templates.
