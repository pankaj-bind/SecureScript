  "info": "\"The policy allows you to determine whether applications inside Microsoft Defender Application Guard can access the device's camera and microphone.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template AppHVSI.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1809 & Server 2019 Administrative Templates (or newer).\n\nNote #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named\n\nAllow camera and microphone access in Windows Defender Application Guard\n\n, but it was renamed to\n\nAllow camera and microphone access in Microsoft Defender Application Guard\n\nstarting with the Windows 10 Release 2004 Administrative Templates.",

  "Impact": "Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.\n\nThis is the default value so impact should be minimal to enforce this setting.\"",
