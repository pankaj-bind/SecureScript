  "info": "This policy setting allows you to configure whether or not enhanced startup PINs are used with BitLocker.\n\nEnhanced startup PINs permit the use of characters including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nA numeric-only PIN provides less entropy than a PIN that is alpha-numeric. When not using enhanced PIN for startup, BitLocker requires the use of the function keys [F1-F10] for PIN entry since the PIN is entered in the pre-OS environment before localization support is available. This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities. The TPM has an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to more effectively mount a brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of the function keys.",

  "Note": "Not all computers enable full keyboard support in the Pre-OS environment. Some keys may not be available. It is recommended this functionality be tested using the computers in your environment prior to it being deployed.\"",
  "Impact": "All new BitLocker startup PINs set will be enhanced PINs.",
