  "info": "\"This setting lets users turn on Credential Guard with virtualization-based security to help protect credentials. The 'Enabled with UEFI lock' option ensures that Credential Guard cannot be disabled remotely. In order to disable the feature, you must set the Group Policy to 'Disabled' as well as remove the security functionality from each computer, with a physically present user, in order to clear configuration persisted in UEFI.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled with UEFI lock",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template DeviceGuard.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1511 Administrative Templates (or newer).",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled with UEFI lock :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Device Guard\\Turn On Virtualization Based Security: Credential Guard Configuration",
  "Impact": "Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.",
  "Warning": "All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are known to be compatible.\n\nWarning #2: Once this setting is turned on and active, Credential Guard cannot be disabled solely via GPO or any other remote method. After removing the setting from GPO, the features must also be manually disabled\n\nlocally at the machine\n\nusing the steps provided at this link:\n\nManage Windows Defender Credential Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs\"",
