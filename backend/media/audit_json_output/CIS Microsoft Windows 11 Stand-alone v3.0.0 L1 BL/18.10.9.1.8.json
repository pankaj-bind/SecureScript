  "info": "This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.\n\nIn 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Backup recovery passwords and key packages\n\nAdministrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.\n\nAdditionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.\n\nTo use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.",
