  "info": "\"The Web Management Service enables remote and delegated management capabilities for administrators to manage for the Web server, sites and applications present on the machine.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed",
  "Note": "This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed by enabling an optional Windows feature (\n\nInternet Information Services - Web Management Tools - IIS Management Service\n\n).\n\nRemote web administration of IIS on a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.\"",
