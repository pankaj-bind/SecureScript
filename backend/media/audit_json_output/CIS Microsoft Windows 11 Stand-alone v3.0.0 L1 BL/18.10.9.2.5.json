  "info": "This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.\n\nIn 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Require 48-digit recovery password\n\nShould a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there.",
