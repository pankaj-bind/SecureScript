  "info": "This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.\n\nIn 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Allow 48-digit recovery password or Enabled: Require 48-digit recovery password\n\nAdministrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.\n\nAdditionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.\n\nTo use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key.",
