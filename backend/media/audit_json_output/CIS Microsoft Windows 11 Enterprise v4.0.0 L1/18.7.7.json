  "info": "This policy setting controls which port is used for RPC over TCP for incoming connections to the print spooler and outgoing connections to remote print spoolers.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 0\n\nUsing dynamic ports for printing makes it more difficult for an attacker to know which port is being used and therefore which port to attack.",

  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template Printing.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 22H2 Administrative Templates v1.0 (or newer).",
  "Impact": "If your current print environment is configured for a specific TCP port, this setting may require a firewall change (if applicable) for continued printing.\"",
