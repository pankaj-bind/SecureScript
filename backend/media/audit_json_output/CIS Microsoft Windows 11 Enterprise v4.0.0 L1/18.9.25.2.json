It is provided by the Group Policy template LAPS.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 23H2 Administrative Templates v2.0 (or newer).\n\nNote #2: This setting also existed in the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 22H2 v3.0 and 23H2 v1.0 Administrative Templates, but it was misconfigured in those versions with the incorrect registry value. Please ensure you are using Windows 11 Release 23H2 Administrative Templates v2.0 (or newer) when configuring this setting to ensure the correct registry value is set.",
