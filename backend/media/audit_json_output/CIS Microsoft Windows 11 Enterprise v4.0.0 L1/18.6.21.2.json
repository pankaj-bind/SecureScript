  "description": "18.6.21.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network' is set to 'Enabled'",
  "info": "This policy setting prevents computers from connecting to both a domain based network and a non-domain based network at the same time.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled\n\nThe potential concern is that a user would unknowingly allow network traffic to flow between the insecure public network and the enterprise managed network.",
  "solution": "\"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled :\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Network\\Windows Connection Manager\\Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template WCM.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.0 & Server 2012 (non-R2) Administrative Templates (or newer).",
  "Impact": "The computer responds to automatic and manual network connection attempts based on the following circumstances:\n\nAutomatic connection attempts\n\n- When the computer is already connected to a domain based network, all automatic connection attempts to non-domain networks are blocked. - When the computer is already connected to a non-domain based network, automatic connection attempts to domain based networks are blocked.\n\nManual connection attempts\n\n- When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain based network over media other than Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing network connection is disconnected and the manual connection is allowed. - When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain based network over Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing Ethernet connection is maintained and the manual connection attempt is blocked.\"",
