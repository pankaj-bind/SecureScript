  "info": "\"This policy setting allows you to decide whether auditing events can be collected from Microsoft Defender Application Guard.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled",
  "Note": "This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template AppHVSI.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates (or newer).\n\nNote #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named\n\nAllow auditing events in Windows Defender Application Guard\n\n, but it was renamed to\n\nAllow auditing events in Microsoft Defender Application Guard\n\nstarting with the Windows 10 Release 2004 Administrative Templates.",

  "Impact": "Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11 Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware compatibility is no longer an issue.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Application Guard will inherit its auditing policies from Microsoft Edge and start to audit system events specifically for Microsoft Defender Application Guard. Collected logs are available for review on Microsoft Edge, outside of Application Guard.\"",
