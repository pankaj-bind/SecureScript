      info        : "This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The 'Allow data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.

When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the 'Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile' group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

Note: If the group policy setting 'Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations' is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled

Secure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and other types of malware from gaining control of the system. It also helps provide protection against malicious users booting from an alternate operating system."

The 'Allow certificate-based data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services', choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for operating system drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

      description : "2.3.7.3 (BL) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Machine account lockout threshold' is set to '10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0'"
      info        : "This security setting determines the number of failed logon attempts that causes the machine to be locked out.

Failed password attempts against workstations or member servers that have been locked using either CTRL+ALT+DELETE or password protected screen savers counts as failed logon attempts.

The machine lockout policy is enforced only on those machines that have BitLocker enabled for protecting OS volumes. Please ensure that appropriate recovery password backup policies are enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: 10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0

Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine account lockout threshold. Values from 1 to 3 will be interpreted as 4

If a machine is lost or stolen, or if an insider threat attempts a brute force password attack against the computer, it is important to ensure that BitLocker will lock the computer and therefore prevent a successful attack."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0 :

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Machine account lockout threshold

Impact:

Users will be able to mistype their password several times, but the machine account will be locked out if a brute force password attack occurs. A locked out machine can only be recovered by providing the BitLocker recovery key at the console."
